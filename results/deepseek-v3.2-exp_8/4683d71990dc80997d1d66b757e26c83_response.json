Since it's about lineage, I should trace the ancestors and descendants.\n\nLet me start with Albert. Brittany is Albert's ancestor. And Bradley is Brittany's ancestor. So, Bradley → Brittany → Albert.\n\nAlso, Carl is Bradley's ancestor, so Carl → Bradley → Brittany → Albert.\n\nTheresa is Carl's ancestor, so Theresa → Carl → Bradley → Brittany → Albert.\n\nSo, Theresa is an ancestor of Albert.\n\nNow, for Kenneth. Christian is Kenneth's ancestor. Jessica is Christian's ancestor, so Jessica → Christian → Kenneth.\n\nTheresa is Jessica's ancestor, so Theresa → Jessica → Christian → Kenneth.\n\nSo, Theresa is also an ancestor of Kenneth.\n\nTherefore, both Albert and Kenneth have Theresa as a common ancestor.\n\nSo, Albert and Kenneth share a common ancestor, which is Theresa.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1.

From the chains, Albert is descended from Theresa through Carl, Bradley, Brittany, and Kenneth is descended from Theresa through Jessica and Christian. There's no direct line between Albert and Kenneth; they both connect to Theresa.\n\nSo, they share a common ancestor, Theresa.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1.\n\nI should ensure that there is no other relationship. For example, is Albert an ancestor of Kenneth? From the chains, Albert is at the end of one chain, and Kenneth is at the end of another chain, so no, Albert is not an ancestor of Kenneth, nor is Kenneth an ancestor of Albert. They are both descendants of Theresa.\n\nSo, option 3 and 4 are incorrect.\n\nOption 2 is about sharing a common descendant. But from the information, we don't know if Albert and Kenneth have any common descendants; we only know about their ancestors.
