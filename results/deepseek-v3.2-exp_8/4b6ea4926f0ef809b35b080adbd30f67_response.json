From 1: Christina is Nicholas's ancestor. So, Christina → Nicholas.\n\nFrom 3: Nicholas is Michelle's ancestor. So, Nicholas → Michelle.\n\nCombining these, Christina → Nicholas → Michelle.\n\nFrom 2: Gregory is Michelle's descendant. So, Michelle → Gregory.\n\nNow, from 5: Amber is Gregory's descendant. So, Gregory → Amber.\n\nSo, putting this together: Christina → Nicholas → Michelle → Gregory → Amber.\n\nSo, Christina is an ancestor of Amber.\n\nNow, let's look at the other relationships.\n\nFrom 4: Richard is Anna's ancestor. So, Richard → Anna.\n\nFrom 7: Christina is Anna's descendant. Wait, descendant? That means Anna is Christina's ancestor? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Christina is Anna's descendant.\" That means Anna is Christina's ancestor. So, Anna → Christina.\n\nSimilarly, from 6: Richard is Mary's descendant. That means Mary is Richard's ancestor. So, Mary → Richard.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nAnna → Christina (from 7)\n\nAnd Richard → Anna (from 4)\n\nBut from 6, Mary → Richard.\n\nSo, Mary → Richard → Anna → Christina.\n\nNow, from earlier, we have Christina → Nicholas → Michelle → Gregory → Amber.\n\nSo, connecting both chains: Mary → Richard → Anna → Christina → Nicholas → Michelle → Gregory → Amber.\n\nTherefore, Mary is an ancestor of Amber.\n\nSo, Amber is Mary's descendant.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n1. Amber is Mary's ancestor. - This is false, since Amber is Mary's descendant.\n\n2. Amber and Mary share a common ancestor. - Well, they might, but since Mary is an ancestor of Amber, they share Mary as a common ancestor? But typically, \"share a common ancestor\" means they have an ancestor in common, but since Mary is directly an ancestor, it might not be phrased that way. But let's see.\n\n3. Amber and Mary share a common descendant. - Amber is a descendant of Mary, so Mary has Amber as a descendant, but Amber might not have a descendant mentioned, so they don't share a common descendant because Mary is the ancestor.\n\n4. Amber is Mary's descendant. - This seems correct based on my reasoning.\n\n5.
