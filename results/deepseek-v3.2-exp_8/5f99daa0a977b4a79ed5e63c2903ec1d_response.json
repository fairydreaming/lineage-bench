Frances is Heather's descendant.\n\n6. Alexis is Eugene's descendant.\n\n7. Frances is William's ancestor.\n\nI need to find how Eugene and Bradley are related. Since it's about lineage, I should try to map out the family tree or find connections between these people.\n\nLet me start by noting that ancestor means someone further up the family tree, and descendant means someone further down. So, if A is B's ancestor, then B is A's descendant.\n\nFrom point 1: Doris → Maria (Doris is Maria's ancestor)\n\nFrom point 2: Bradley is Maria's descendant, so Maria → Bradley\n\nSo, combining 1 and 2: Doris → Maria → Bradley. So Doris is Bradley's ancestor, but we need Eugene and Bradley.\n\nNow, point 4: Doris is William's descendant. So William → Doris\n\nBut from above, Doris → Maria → Bradley, so William → Doris → Maria → Bradley. So William is an ancestor of Bradley.\n\nPoint 7: Frances is William's ancestor. So Frances → William\n\nSo, Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley. So Frances is also an ancestor of Bradley.\n\nNow, let's look at the other points.\n\nPoint 3: Alexis is Heather's ancestor. So Alexis → Heather\n\nPoint 5: Frances is Heather's descendant. So Heather → Frances\n\nBut from point 7, Frances → William, so Heather → Frances → William\n\nSo, Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley\n\nSo Alexis is an ancestor of Bradley.\n\nNow point 6: Alexis is Eugene's descendant. So Eugene → Alexis\n\nSince Alexis is Eugene's descendant, that means Eugene is Alexis's ancestor.\n\nSo, from above: Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley\n\nTherefore, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley.\n\nSo, the relationship between Eugene and Bradley is that Eugene is Bradley's ancestor.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n1. Eugene is Bradley's ancestor.\n\n2. Eugene and Bradley share a common ancestor.\n\n3. Eugene is Bradley's descendant.\n\n4. Eugene and Bradley share a common descendant.\n\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option 1 seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any inconsistencies.\n\nWe have point 6: Alexis is Eugene's descendant, which I used as Eugene → Alexis.\n\nAnd from point 3: Alexis is Heather's ancestor, so Alexis → Heather.\n\nPoint 5: Frances is Heather's descendant, so Heather → Frances.\n\nPoint 7: Frances is William's ancestor, so Frances → William.\n\nPoint 4: Doris is William's descendant, so William → Doris.\n\nPoint 1: Doris is Maria's ancestor, so Doris → Maria.\n\nPoint 2: Bradley is Maria's descendant, so Maria → Bradley.\n\nSo all connections are consistent, and Eugene is indeed an ancestor of Bradley.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1.\n\nI should ensure that there are no other relationships that might contradict this. For example, is there any direct relationship between Eugene and Bradley that might be different? But from the chain, it seems clear.\n\nAlso, note that in the chain, I have Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley, which is a long chain, but it establishes Eugene as an ancestor.\n\nSo, I think it's correct.","reasoning_details":[{"format":"unknown","index":0,"type":"reasoning.text","text":"First, I need to figure out the lineage relationships between Eugene and Bradley based on the given information.
