I'll list out all the relationships clearly:\n\n1. Nancy is Julie's descendant. So, Julie is an ancestor of Nancy.\n\n2. Christopher is Edward's ancestor. So, Christopher is an ancestor of Edward.\n\n3. Frank is Catherine's descendant. So, Catherine is an ancestor of Frank.\n\n4. Frank is Roger's ancestor. So, Frank is an ancestor of Roger.\n\n5. Terry is Christopher's ancestor. So, Terry is an ancestor of Christopher.\n\n6. Catherine is Terry's descendant. So, Terry is an ancestor of Catherine.\n\n7. Julie is Edward's descendant. So, Edward is an ancestor of Julie.\n\nNow, I need to connect these to find how Roger and Nancy are related.\n\nLet me start by linking the relationships involving Edward, Christopher, Terry, and Catherine.\n\nFrom (2): Christopher is Edward's ancestor. So, Christopher → Edward.\n\nFrom (5): Terry is Christopher's ancestor. So, Terry → Christopher.\n\nTherefore, Terry → Christopher → Edward.\n\nFrom (6): Catherine is Terry's descendant. So, Terry → Catherine.\n\nBut Terry is already an ancestor of Christopher and Edward. So, Catherine is also a descendant of Terry, meaning Terry is an ancestor of Catherine.\n\nNow, from (3): Frank is Catherine's descendant. So, Catherine → Frank.\n\nAnd from (4): Frank is Roger's ancestor. So, Frank → Roger.\n\nSo, we have Terry → Catherine → Frank → Roger.\n\nBut Terry is also → Christopher → Edward.\n\nNow, let's look at Julie and Nancy.\n\nFrom (1): Nancy is Julie's descendant. So, Julie → Nancy.\n\nFrom (7): Julie is Edward's descendant. So, Edward → Julie.\n\nBut from above, Edward is a descendant of Christopher, who is a descendant of Terry. So, Edward → Julie, but since Edward is a descendant, let's think in terms of ancestors.\n\nIf Edward is an ancestor of Julie, and Christopher is an ancestor of Edward, then Christopher is an ancestor of Julie as well. Similarly, Terry is an ancestor of Christopher, so Terry is an ancestor of Julie.\n\nSo, Terry → Christopher → Edward → Julie.\n\nAnd from Julie → Nancy, so Terry → Christopher → Edward → Julie → Nancy.\n\nNow, we also have Terry → Catherine → Frank → Roger.\n\nSo, Terry is a common ancestor to both Nancy and Roger.\n\nNancy is in the line: Terry → Christopher → Edward → Julie → Nancy\n\nRoger is in the line: Terry → Catherine → Frank → Roger\n\nTherefore, Terry is a common ancestor of both Roger and Nancy.\n\nSo, Roger and Nancy share a common ancestor, which is Terry.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n1. Roger and Nancy share a common descendant.\n\n2. Roger is Nancy's descendant.\n\n3. Roger and Nancy share a common ancestor.\n\n4. Roger is Nancy's ancestor.\n\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option 3 seems correct: Roger and Nancy share a common ancestor.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is any direct relationship or if one is the ancestor of the other.\n\nFrom the chains, Roger is descended from Terry via Catherine and Frank, and Nancy is descended from Terry via Christopher, Edward, and Julie. So, they are both descendants of Terry, but they are not directly related in a parent-child way; they share a common ancestor.\n\nIs there any path where Roger is an ancestor of Nancy or vice versa? From the chains, Nancy is descended from Julie, who is descended from Edward, who is descended from Christopher, who is descended from Terry. Roger is descended from Frank, who is descended from Catherine, who is descended from Terry. So, Roger and Nancy are on different branches from Terry.
