The options are about whether they share a common descendant, if Mary is Logan's descendant, if they share a common ancestor, if Mary is Logan's ancestor, or none of the above.\n\nTo figure this out, I should trace the family tree based on the given relationships. Since there are many people, I need to focus on Mary and Logan and see how they connect through the lineage paths.\n\nLet me list out the relationships that directly or indirectly involve Mary or Logan.\n\nStarting with Logan: Logan is Arthur's descendant. From the list: \"Logan is Arthur's descendant.\"\n\nNow, Mary: I see \"Mary is Martha's descendant.\" So Mary is Martha's descendant.\n\nBut I need to connect them. Maybe through common ancestors or descendants.\n\nPerhaps I should find a path that links Mary and Logan through the relationships.\n\nSince Logan is Arthur's descendant, and Arthur might be connected to others, similarly for Mary.\n\nLet me try to build a tree or find connections.\n\nFirst, from the list:\n\n- Logan is Arthur's descendant. That means Arthur is Logan's ancestor, but not necessarily direct; it could be any ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, Mary is Martha's descendant, so Martha is Mary's ancestor.\n\nNow, I need to see if there's a common ancestor or something.\n\nOption 3 is \"Mary and Logan share a common ancestor,\" which might be possible.\n\nOption 2 is Mary is Logan's descendant, meaning Mary is a descendant of Logan, or Logan's descendant?\n\n\"Mary is Logan's descendant\" means Mary is a descendant of Logan, so Logan is an ancestor of Mary.\n\nSimilarly, \"Logan is Arthur's descendant\" means Logan is a descendant of Arthur, so Arthur is an ancestor of Logan.\n\nI should use \"descendant of\" to mean the person is lower in the tree, so if X is Y's descendant, then Y is an ancestor of X.\n\nFor example, Arthur is Sharon's descendant, so Arthur is a descendant of Sharon, meaning Sharon is Arthur's ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, Beverly is Melissa's ancestor, so Beverly is an ancestor of Melissa.\n\nBetty is Cheryl's ancestor, etc.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\n- If \"A is B's descendant\", then B is A's ancestor.\n\n- If \"A is B's ancestor\", then A is B's ancestor, so B is A's descendant.\n\nIn the phrasing: \"A is B's descendant\" means A is descendant of B, so B is ancestor of A.\n\n\"A is B's ancestor\" means A is ancestor of B, so B is descendant of A.\n\nNow for Mary and Logan.\n\nLogan is Arthur's descendant, so Arthur is ancestor of Logan.\n\nMary is Martha's descendant, so Martha is ancestor of Mary.\n\nBut I need to see if they connect.\n\nPerhaps I need to find if Arthur and Martha are related, or if there's a path.\n\nSince the relationships are given, I should start from Logan and go up, and from Mary and go up, to find a common point.\n\nLet me begin with Logan.\n\nLogan is Arthur's descendant. So, Arthur is ancestor of Logan.\n\nNow, what about Arthur? Is there information about Arthur's ancestors?\n\nArthur is Sharon's descendant, so Arthur is descendant of Sharon, meaning Sharon is Arthur's ancestor.\n\nSo Sharon is ancestor of Arthur, who is ancestor of Logan, so Sharon is ancestor of Logan.\n\nNow, is there more about Sharon?\n\nHenry is Sharon's ancestor. So Henry is ancestor of Sharon, so Henry is ancestor of Logan.\n\nSimilarly, Henry is Gregory's descendant. \"Henry is Gregory's descendant\" so Henry is descendant of Gregory, meaning Gregory is ancestor of Henry, and thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nGregory is Donald's descendant. \"Gregory is Donald's descendant\" so Donald is ancestor of Gregory, and thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nDonald is Doris's ancestor. \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" so Doris is ancestor of Donald, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nDoris is Alexander's descendant. \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\" so Alexander is ancestor of Doris, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nAlexander is Madison's descendant. \"Alexander is Madison's descendant\" so Madison is ancestor of Alexander, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nMadison? I need to see if that goes further.\n\nWalter is Madison's ancestor? \"Walter is Madison's ancestor\" so Walter is ancestor of Madison, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I might not need to go all the way; perhaps I can stop if I find Mary.\n\nNow for Mary.\n\nMary is Martha's descendant. So Martha is ancestor of Mary.\n\nWhat about Martha? I need to see Martha's ancestors.\n\nStephen is Martha's ancestor. \"Stephen is Brian's descendant\" – no.\n\n\"Stephen is Brian's descendant\" so Stephen is descendant of Brian, meaning Brian is ancestor of Stephen.\n\nBut I need Martha.\n\nMartha is mentioned: \"Mary is Martha's descendant\" and \"Stephen is Martha's ancestor\" – Stephen is Martha's ancestor, so Martha is descendant of Stephen.\n\n\"Stephen is Martha's ancestor\" so Stephen is ancestor of Martha, thus ancestor of Mary.\n\nStephen is Brian's descendant, so Brian is ancestor of Stephen, thus ancestor of Martha, thus ancestor of Mary.\n\nBrian is... let's see.\n\n\"Denise is Brian's ancestor\" – \"Denise is Bradley's descendant\" and \"Denise is Brian's ancestor\" – I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me list all mentions of Martha and Mary.\n\nMary: \"Mary is Martha's descendant.\"\n\nMartha: \"Stephen is Martha's ancestor.\" \"Stephen is Brian's descendant.\"\n\nAlso, \"Mary is Martha's descendant\" and \"Martha is descendant of Stephen.\"\n\nStephen: \"Stephen is Brian's descendant.\" \"Stephen is Martha's ancestor.\"\n\nBrian: \"Denise is Brian's ancestor.\" \"Stephen is Brian's descendant.\"\n\nDenise: \"Denise is Bradley's descendant.\" \"Denise is Brian's ancestor.\"\n\nBradley: \"Shirley is Bradley's ancestor.\" \"Denise is Bradley's descendant.\"\n\nShirley: \"Shirley is

\"Virginia is Joan's descendant.\"\n\nJoan: \"Virginia is Joan's descendant\" and \"Joan is Kathryn's descendant.\"\n\nKathryn: \"Joan is Kathryn's descendant\" and \"Peter is Kathryn's ancestor.\"\n\nPeter: \"Peter is Kathryn's ancestor\" and \"Susan is Peter's ancestor.\"\n\nSusan: \"Susan is Peter's ancestor\" and \"Ethan is Susan's ancestor.\"\n\nEthan: \"Ethan is Susan's ancestor\" and \"Ethan is Janet's descendant.\"\n\nJanet: \"Ethan is Janet's descendant\" and \"Janet is Brandon's descendant.\"\n\nBrandon: \"Janet is Brandon's descendant\" and \"Brandon is Karen's descendant.\"\n\nKaren: \"Brandon is Karen's descendant\" and \"Karen is Billy's descendant.\"\n\nBilly: \"Karen is Billy's descendant\" and \"Victoria is Billy's ancestor.\"\n\nVictoria: \"Victoria is Billy's ancestor\" and \"Victoria is Alan's descendant.\"\n\nAlan: \"Victoria is Alan's descendant\" and \"Margaret is Alan's ancestor.\"\n\nMargaret: \"Margaret is Al's ancestor\" and \"Margaret is Nicole's descendant.\"\n\nNicole: \"Margaret is Nicole's descendant\" and \"Eric is Nicole's ancestor.\"\n\nEric: \"Eric is Nicole's ancestor\" and \"Jose is Eric's ancestor.\"\n\nJose: \"Jose is Eric's ancestor\" and \"Jacqueline is Jose's ancestor.\"\n\nJacqueline: \"Jacqueline is Jose's ancestor\" and \"Alexis is Jacqueline's ancestor.\"\n\nAlexis: \"Alexis is Jacqueline's ancestor\" and \"Alexis is Catherine's descendant.\"\n\nCatherine: \"Alexis is Catherine's descendant\" and \"Frances is Catherine's ancestor.\"\n\nFrances: \"Frances is Catherine's ancestor\" and \"Frances is Aaron's descendant.\"\n\nAaron: \"Frances is Aaron's descendant\" and \"Aaron is Ann's descendant.\"\n\nAnn: \"Aaron is Ann's descendant\" and \"Ann is Isabella's descendant.\"\n\nIsabella: \"Ann is Isabella's descendant\" and \"Brenda is Isabella's ancestor.\"\n\nBrenda: \"Brenda is Isabella's ancestor\" and \"Brenda is Jonathan's descendant.\"\n\nJonathan: \"Brenda is Jonathan's descendant\" and \"Lisa is Jonathan's ancestor.\"\n\nLisa: \"Lisa is Jonathan's ancestor\" and \"Justin is Lisa's ancestor.\"\n\nJustin: \"Justin is Lisa's ancestor\" and \"Rachel is Justin's ancestor.\"\n\nRachel: \"Rachel is Justin's ancestor\" and \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor.\"\n\nBenjamin: \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor\" and \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant.\"\n\nGabriel: \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\" and \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor.\"\n\nAndrew: \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor\" and \"Andrew is Helen's descendant.\"\n\nHelen: \"Andrew is Helen's descendant\" and \"Anna is Helen's ancestor.\"\n\nAnna: \"Anna is Helen's ancestor\" and \"Jacob is Anna's ancestor.\"\n\nJacob: \"Jacob is Anna's ancestor\" and \"Jack is Jacob's ancestor.\"\n\nJack: \"Jack is Jacob's ancestor\" and \"Jack is Judith's descendant.\"\n\nJudith: \"Jack is Judith's descendant\" and \"Judith is Megan's descendant.\"\n\nMegan: \"Judith is Megan's descendant\" and \"Megan is Joseph's descendant.\"\n\nJoseph: \"Megan is Joseph's descendant\" and \"Joseph is Natalie's descendant.\"\n\nNatalie: \"Joseph is Natalie's descendant\" and \"Barbara is Natalie's ancestor.\"\n\nBarbara: \"Barbara is Natalie's ancestor\" and \"Julie is Barbara's ancestor.\"\n\nJulie: \"Julie is Barbara's ancestor\" and \"Jesse is Julie's ancestor.\"\n\nJesse: \"Jesse is Julie's ancestor\" and \"Gerald is Sandra's ancestor\" and \"Jesse is Sandra's descendant\" – I think I have a loop or something.\n\nJesse is Sandra's descendant, but also Jesse is Julie's ancestor? Not consistent.\n\n\"Jesse is Julie's ancestor\" and \"Jesse is Sandra's descendant\" – so if Jesse is Sandra's descendant, Sandra is ancestor of Jesse, but if Jesse is Julie's ancestor, Jesse is ancestor of Julie, so Sandra could be ancestor of Julie or something.\n\nBut let's not digress; I was tracing Mary to her ancestors.\n\nFrom Mary down to Martha to Stephen to Brian to Denise to Bradley to Shirley to Janice to Virginia to Joan to Kathryn to Peter to Susan to Ethan to Janet to Brandon to Karen to Billy to Victoria to Alan to Margaret to Nicole to Eric to Jose to Jacqueline to Alexis to Catherine to Frances to Aaron to Ann to Isabella to Brenda to Jonathan to Lisa to Justin to Rachel to Benjamin to Gabriel to Andrew to Helen to Anna to Jacob to Jack to Judith to Megan to Joseph to Natalie to Barbara to Julie to Jesse.\n\nBut Jesse is also connected to Sandra, but I think for Mary, I have a chain.\n\nBut this is getting long, and I might have made a mistake because it's circular or something. Let's simplify.\n\nSince Mary is Martha's descendant, and Martha is descendant of Stephen, etc., but for Logan, I have a different chain.\n\nLogan is Arthur's descendant, Arthur is Sharon's descendant, Sharon is descendant of Henry, Henry is Gregory's descendant, Gregory is Donald's descendant, Donald is Doris's ancestor? \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" so Doris is ancestor of Donald.\n\n\"Gregory is Donald's descendant\" so Donald is ancestor of Gregory.\n\nDoris is Donald's ancestor, so Doris is ancestor of Gregory? Let's see:\n\n- Donald is ancestor of Gregory (since Gregory is Donald's descendant)\n\n- Doris is ancestor of Donald (since Doris is Donald's ancestor)\n\nSo Doris is ancestor of Donald, who is ancestor of Gregory, so Doris is ancestor of Gregory, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nDoris is Alexander's descendant, so Alexander is ancestor of Doris, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nAlexander is Madison's descendant, so Madison is ancestor of Alexander, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nWalter is Madison's ancestor, so Walter is ancestor of Madison, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, for Mary, from above, I have a long chain, but I need to see if any of these ancestors match or if there's a common point.\n\nPerhaps Mary and Logan share a common ancestor through Martha and Arthur or something.\n\nBut let's look for a direct link or a shorter path.\n\nI recall that there is \"Laura is Carol's descendant\" and \"Carol is Bobby's descendant\", but not sure.\n\nAnother thing: there is \"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" and \"Lauren is Richard's descendant\", etc.\n\nBut let's think about the options. Option 3 is \"Mary and Logan share a common ancestor.\" That might be true.\n\nBut let's see if I can find that common ancestor.\n\nPerhaps from the list, I can find if Arthur and Martha are related.\n\nArthur and Martha don't seem directly related, but their ancestors might be.\n\nLet's list the ancestors of Logan and Mary and see if there's overlap.\n\nFirst, Logan:\n\n- Logan is Arthur's descendant → Arthur is ancestor\n\n- Arthur is Sharon's descendant → Sharon is ancestor\n\n- Sharon is descendant of Henry? \"Henry is Sharon's ancestor\" so Henry is ancestor of Sharon, thus of Arthur and Logan.\n\n- Henry is Gregory's descendant → Gregory is ancestor of Henry, thus of Logan\n\n- Gregory is Donald's descendant → Donald is ancestor of Gregory, thus of Logan\n\n- Donald is Doris's ancestor → Doris is ancestor of Donald, thus of Logan\n\n- Doris is Alexander's descendant → Alexander is ancestor of Doris, thus of Logan\n\n- Alexander is Madison's descendant → Madison is ancestor of Alexander, thus of Logan\n\n- Walter is Madison's ancestor → Walter is ancestor of Madison, thus of Logan\n\nNow for Mary:\n\n- Mary is Martha's descendant → Martha is ancestor\n\n- Martha is descendant of Stephen → Stephen is ancestor\n\n- Stephen is Brian's descendant → Brian is ancestor\n\n- Denise is Brian's ancestor → Denise is ancestor of Brian, thus of Stephen and Mary\n\n- Denise is Bradley's descendant → Bradley is ancestor of Denise, thus of Brian, Stephen, Mary\n\n- Shirley is Bradley's ancestor → Shirley is ancestor of Bradley, thus of Denise, Brian, Stephen, Mary\n\n- Janice is Shirley's ancestor → Janice is ancestor of Shirley, thus of all above\n\n- Virginia is Janice's ancestor → Virginia is ancestor of Janice, thus of all above\n\n- Virginia is Joan's descendant → Joan is ancestor of Virginia, thus of Janice, Shirley, etc., so ancestor of Mary\n\n- Joan is Kathryn's descendant → Kathryn is ancestor of Joan, thus of Virginia, Janice, etc.\n\n- Peter is Kathryn's ancestor → Peter is ancestor of Kathryn, thus of Joan, Virginia, etc.\n\n- Susan is Peter's ancestor → Susan is ancestor of Peter, thus of Kathryn, Joan, etc.\n\n- Ethan is Susan's ancestor → Ethan is ancestor of Susan, thus of Peter, Kathryn, etc.\n\n- Ethan is Janet's descendant → Janet is ancestor of Ethan, thus of Susan, Peter, etc.\n\n- Janet is Brandon's descendant → Brandon is ancestor of Janet, thus of Ethan, Susan, etc.\n\n- Brandon is Karen's descendant → Karen is ancestor of Brandon, thus of Janet, Ethan, etc.\n\n- Karen is Billy's descendant → Billy is ancestor of Karen, thus of Brandon, Janet, etc.\n\n- Victoria is Billy's ancestor → Victoria is ancestor of Billy, thus of Karen, Brandon, etc.\n\n- Victoria is Alan's descendant → Alan is ancestor of Victoria, thus of Billy, Karen, etc.\n\n- Margaret is Alan's ancestor → Margaret is ancestor of Alan, thus of Victoria, Billy, etc.\n\n- Margaret is Nicole's descendant → Nicole is ancestor of Margaret, thus of Alan, Victoria, etc.\n\n- Eric is Nicole's ancestor → Eric is ancestor of Nicole, thus of Margaret, Alan, etc.\n\n- Jose is Eric's ancestor → Jose is ancestor of Eric, thus of Nicole, Margaret, etc.\n\n- Jacqueline is Jose's ancestor → Jacqueline is ancestor of Jose, thus of Eric, Nicole, etc.\n\n- Alexis is Jacqueline's ancestor → Alexis is ancestor of Jacqueline, thus of Jose, Eric, etc.\n\n- Alexis is Catherine's descendant → Catherine is ancestor of Alexis, thus of Jacqueline, Jose, etc.\n\n- Frances is Catherine's ancestor → Frances is ancestor of Catherine, thus of Alexis, Jacqueline, etc.\n\n- Frances is Aaron's descendant → Aaron is ancestor of Frances, thus of Catherine, Alexis, etc.\n\n- Aaron is Ann's descendant → Ann is ancestor of Aaron, thus of Frances, Catherine, etc.\n\n- Ann is Isabella's descendant → Isabella is ancestor of Ann, thus of Aaron, Frances, etc.\n\n- Brenda is Isabella's ancestor → Brenda is ancestor of Isabella, thus of Ann, Aaron, etc.\n\n- Brenda is Jonathan's descendant → Jonathan is ancestor of Brenda, thus of Isabella, Ann, etc.\n\n- Lisa is Jonathan's ancestor → Lisa is ancestor of Jonathan, thus of Brenda, Isabella, etc.\n\n- Justin is Lisa's ancestor → Justin is ancestor of Lisa, thus of Jonathan, Brenda, etc.\n\n- Rachel is Justin's ancestor → Rachel is ancestor of Justin, thus of Lisa, Jonathan, etc.\n\n- Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor → Benjamin is ancestor of Rachel, thus of Justin, Lisa, etc.\n\n- Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant → Gabriel is ancestor of Benjamin, thus of Rachel, Justin, etc.\n\n- Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor → Andrew is ancestor of Gabriel, thus of Benjamin, Rachel, etc.\n\n- Andrew is Helen's descendant → Helen is ancestor of Andrew, thus of Gabriel, Benjamin, etc.\n\n- Anna is Helen's ancestor → Anna is ancestor of Helen, thus of Andrew, Gabriel, etc.\n\n- Jacob is Anna's ancestor → Jacob is ancestor of Anna, thus of Helen, Andrew, etc.\n\n- Jack is

Megan is ancestor of Judith, thus of Jack, Jacob, etc.\n\n- Megan is Joseph's descendant → Joseph is ancestor of Megan, thus of Judith, Jack, etc.\n\n- Joseph is Natalie's descendant → Natalie is ancestor of Joseph, thus of Megan, Judith, etc.\n\n- Barbara is Natalie's ancestor → Barbara is ancestor of Natalie, thus of Joseph, Megan, etc.\n\n- Julie is Barbara's ancestor → Julie is ancestor of Barbara, thus of Natalie, Joseph, etc.\n\n- Jesse is Julie's ancestor → Jesse is ancestor of Julie, thus of Barbara, Natalie, etc.\n\nJesse is also mentioned elsewhere, but for Mary, this is the ancestor chain.\n\nNow, for Logan, I had Walter as an ancestor.\n\nWalter: \"Walter is Madison's ancestor\" and \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" but Keith is Mark's descendant, etc.\n\nAlso, \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\n\"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\n\"Walter is Madison's ancestor\" and \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" so Keith is ancestor of Walter? \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" means Walter is descendant of Keith, so Keith is ancestor of Walter.\n\nBut \"Walter is Madison's ancestor\" so Walter is ancestor of Madison.\n\nSo Keith is ancestor of Walter, who is ancestor of Madison, so Keith is ancestor of Madison.\n\nThen Madison is ancestor of Alexander, etc.\n\nBut for Mary, I don't see Madison or Keith in her chain.\n\nMary's chain has many people, but let's see if any of Logan's ancestors appear in Mary's chain.\n\nFor example, is Walter in Mary's chain? I don't think so.\n\nSimilarly, is Jesse in Logan's chain? No.\n\nPerhaps there is a common ancestor higher up.\n\nBut in the options, it might be easier to see if Mary is Logan's descendant or vice versa.\n\n\"Mary is Logan's descendant\" would mean Logan is ancestor of Mary.\n\n\"Logan is Arthur's descendant\" so Arthur is ancestor of Logan, not Mary.\n\nUnless Arthur is ancestor of Mary, but I don't see that.\n\nSimilarly, Martha is ancestor of Mary, but not Logan.\n\nSo probably not directly descendant.\n\nBut option 1 is \"share a common descendant\" which might mean that they have a common child or grandchild, but that seems unlikely since they are in different lines.\n\nOption 2: Mary is Logan's descendant, meaning Mary is descendant of Logan, so Logan is ancestor of Mary.\n\nBut from the chains, Logan is descendant of Arthur, Mary is descendant of Martha, no direct link.\n\nOption 4: Mary is Logan's ancestor, so Mary is ancestor of Logan, meaning Logan is descendant of Mary.\n\nBut Mary is Martha's descendant, so if Mary is ancestor of Logan, that would mean Mary is between Martha and Logan, but Martha and Logan have no direct link.\n\nSo likely not.\n\nOption 3: share a common ancestor.\n\nTo find a common ancestor, I need to find a person who is ancestor of both Mary and Logan.\n\nFrom Mary's chain, the ultimate ancestor I have is Jesse, but Jesse is ancestor of Mary.\n\nFor Logan, Walter is ancestor.\n\nBut Walter and Jesse are different.\n\nPerhaps there is someone above.\n\nFor example, in Logan's chain, I have Doris, who is ancestor of Logan.\n\nDoris is Alexander's descendant, so Alexander is ancestor of Doris.\n\nAlexander is Madison's descendant, Madison is Walter's descendant, etc.\n\nBut Alexander might be in Mary's chain? I don't think so.\n\nLet's check if Alexander is mentioned in Mary's chain.\n\nIn Mary's chain, I have people like Alan, Margaret, Eric, Jose, etc.\n\nAlexander is not there.\n\nSimilarly, for Mary, I have Jesse.\n\nJesse is Sandra's ancestor? \"Jesse is Sandra's ancestor\" and \"Gerald is Sandra's ancestor\" but not related to Logan.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps through the \"descendant\" and \"ancestor\" we can find if they are connected.\n\nI recall that there is \"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" and \"Lauren is Richard's descendant\", but not sure.\n\nLet's list all relationships involving Logan or Mary directly.\n\nFor Logan: Logan is Arthur's descendant. That's it? No other direct for Logan.\n\nThe list has \"Logan is Arthur's descendant\" only.\n\nFor Mary: \"Mary is Martha's descendant.\"\n\nNow, I need to connect Arthur and Martha or their ancestors.\n\nPerhaps Arthur and Martha share a common ancestor through other people.\n\nBut that might be hard.\n\nAnother thought: look for a person who is ancestor to both.\n\nFor example, from the list, there is \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor\" and \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\" but not related.\n\nPerhaps I can use the fact that some people are connected through multiple paths.\n\nFor instance, \"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" and \"Austin is Kyle's descendant\" so Kyle is ancestor of Austin.\n\nBut not helpful.\n\nLet's notice that there is \"Gerald is Sandra's ancestor\" and \"Jesse is Sandra's descendant\" so Sandra is descendant of Jesse.\n\nBut not related.\n\nPerhaps Mary and Logan are both descendants of the same person.\n\nBut who?\n\nLet's think about the beginning of the chains.\n\nFor Logan, his ancestor chain has people like Arthur, Sharon, Henry, Gregory, Donald, Doris, Alexander, Madison, Walter, Keith, Mark, etc.\n\nFor Mary, ancestor chain has Martha, Stephen, Brian, Denise, Bradley, Shirley, Janice, Virginia, Joan, Kathryn, Peter, Susan, Ethan, Janet, Brandon, Karen, Billy, Victoria, Alan, Margaret, Nicole, Eric, Jose, Jacqueline, Alexis, Catherine, Frances, Aaron, Ann, Isabella, Brenda, Jonathan, Lisa, Justin, Rachel, Benjamin, Gabriel, Andrew, Helen, Anna, Jacob, Jack, Judith, Megan, Joseph, Natalie, Barbara, Julie, Jesse.\n\nNow, is there any overlap between these two lists? For example, is Walter in the first list and in the second? No.\n\nIs Jesse in the second and in the first? No.\n\nPerhaps a common ancestor like Adam or someone.\n\nAdam is Linda's ancestor, Linda is Ashley's ancestor, Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor, Lawrence is Raymond's descendant, Raymond is Nicholas's ancestor, etc.\n\nBut not connected to either.\n\nAnother person: \"Diana is Robert's ancestor\" and \"Robert is Brittany's ancestor\", but not related.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that some ancestors are the same.\n\nLet's search for a person who is ancestor to both.\n\nFor example, is there a person like Margaret or Alan who might be in both.\n\nAlan is in Mary's chain, but for Logan, no Alan.\n\nSimilarly, Victoria is in Mary's chain, but for Logan, no Victoria.\n\nPerhaps from the descendant side.\n\n\"Mary and Logan share a common descendant\" – that would mean they have a common child or something, but since they are descendants, they might have descendants, but it's less likely to be the same person.\n\nFor example, Mary has descendants, Logan has descendants, but it's possible they share a descendant if they are in the same line, but here they are from different lines.\n\nSo probably not.\n\nUnless there is a mistake.\n\nLet's look for a direct connection between the chains.\n\nFor instance, in Logan's chain, I have Keith.\n\nKeith is Mark's descendant, Mark is Keith's descendant? \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\n\"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\nThen Keith is Walter's descendant? \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" so Walter is descendant of Keith, so Keith is ancestor of Walter.\n\n\"Walter is Madison's ancestor\" and \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" so Keith is ancestor of Walter.\n\nThen Walter is ancestor of Madison, etc.\n\nNow, in Mary's chain, is there Keith? No.\n\nAnother person: in Logan's chain, Doris is ancestor.\n\nDoris is Donald's ancestor, Donald is Gregory's ancestor.\n\nDoris is Alexander's descendant, Alexander is Madison's descendant.\n\nBut for Mary, Doris is not there.\n\nBut Doris is also \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" and \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\", but also \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\" and \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\", which is consistent, but Doris is not in Mary's chain.\n\nHowever, Doris is \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" and \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\", but I think I have a duplication.\n\n\"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" means Doris is ancestor of Donald.\n\n\"Gregory is Donald's descendant\" so Donald is ancestor of Gregory.\n\nSo Doris is ancestor of Donald, who is ancestor of Gregory, so Doris is ancestor of Gregory.\n\nSimilarly, \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\" so Alexander is ancestor of Doris.\n\nSo Alexander is ancestor of Doris, who is ancestor of Donald, who is ancestor of Gregory, so Alexander is ancestor of Gregory.\n\nFor Mary, Alexander is not in her chain.\n\nBut Alexander is in Logan's chain as ancestor.\n\nMary's chain has Jesse as the ultimate.\n\nJesse is \"Jesse is Sandra's descendant\" and \"Gerald is Sandra's ancestor\", but not related.\n\nPerhaps there is a common ancestor through other means.\n\nLet's list all people who are ancestors to Logan.\n\nFrom above: Arthur, Sharon, Henry, Gregory, Donald, Doris, Alexander, Madison, Walter, Keith, Mark, and others like if I go further.\n\nKeith is Mark's descendant, so Mark is ancestor.\n\nMark is \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\nMark is also \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Mark is descendant of Theresa\"? \"Matthew is Teresa's ancestor\" not Mark.\n\n\"Mark\" is mentioned: \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Keith is Mark's descendant\", that's it? No.\n\n\"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\nAlso, \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" so Keith is ancestor of Walter.\n\nBut Mark is not necessarily ancestor of Walter unless connected.\n\nSimilarly, for Mary, her ancestors include many.\n\nBut let's notice that in Logan's chain, there is Keith, and in Mary's chain, there is Keith? No.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"Benjamin\" is in both.\n\nBenjamin is Rachel's ancestor, and Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant.\n\nFor Logan, no Benjamin.\n\nBut Benjamin is also \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\" and \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor\", but Gabriel is in both chains? No.\n\nGabriel is in Mary's chain as ancestor of Benjamin.\n\nIn Logan's chain, no Gabriel.\n\nHowever, for Logan, there is \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" and Keith is Mark's descendant, but not Gabriel.\n\nPerhaps I need to see if there is a person like Victoria or Alan who is ancestor to both.\n\nAlan is in Mary's chain, and for Logan, Alan is not an ancestor.\n\nBut Alan is \"Victoria is Alan's descendant\" and \"Margaret is Alan's ancestor\", etc.\n\nNot for Logan.\n\nLet's check if Logan has an ancestor named Alan. No.\n\nSimilarly, Victoria is not in Logan's chain.\n\nBut Victoria is \"Victoria is Billy's ancestor\" and \"Victoria is Alan's descendant\", but Billy is in Mary's chain.\n\nFor Logan, Billy is not an ancestor.\n\nPerhaps through \"Austin\" or something.\n\nI recall that there is \"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" and \"Austin is Kyle's descendant\", but Richard is also \"Lauren is Richard's descendant\", but not related.\n\nAnother person: \"Raymond is Lawrence's descendant\" and \"Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor\", but Ashley is Linda's ancestor, Linda is Adam's ancestor, etc.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nPerhaps I can consider that some relationships imply a common ancestor.\n\nFor example, if A is B's ancestor and B is C's ancestor, then A is ancestor of C.\n\nBut for Mary and Logan, they are from different roots.\n\nLet's look for a person who is mentioned as ancestor to someone in both chains.\n\nFor example, is there a person P such that P is ancestor of Mary and P is ancestor of Logan.\n\nFrom Mary's chain, P could be Jesse, for example.\n\nIs Jesse ancestor of Logan? I don't see that.\n\nSimilarly, for Logan, P could be Walter.\n\nIs Walter ancestor of Mary? No.\n\nPerhaps P is not direct, but through a chain.\n\nBut Jesse and Walter are not connected.\n\nUnless there is a person like Margaret who is in both, but Margaret is only in Mary's chain.\n\nMargaret is \"Margaret is Alan's ancestor\" and \"Margaret is Nicole's descendant\", so Nicole is ancestor of Margaret, thus of Alan, Victoria, etc., so of Mary.\n\nFor Logan, Nicole is not an ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, for Logan, we have people like Doris, who is \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" and \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\", but not for Mary.\n\nBut Doris is also \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\" and \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\", and \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\" means Alexander is ancestor of Doris, and \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" so Doris is ancestor of Donald.\n\nSo Doris is between Alexander and Donald.\n\nBut Alexander is ancestor of Doris, Doris is ancestor of Donald, so Alexander is ancestor of Donald.\n\nFor Mary, Alexander is not an ancestor.\n\nHowever, Alexander is \"Alexander is Madison's descendant\" and Madison is \"Walter is Madison's ancestor\", so Walter is ancestor of Madison, who is ancestor of Alexander, who is ancestor of Doris, etc.\n\nBut for Mary, no Madison.\n\nBut Mary has \"Alexander\" in her chain? No, Alexander is not in Mary's chain.\n\nIn Mary's chain, I have people like Alan, but Alan is different.\n\nLet's list the first few ancestors of Mary and Logan.\n\nFor Logan: Arthur -> Sharon -> Henry -> Gregory -> Donald -> Doris -> Alexander -> Madison -> Walter\n\nFor Mary: Martha -> Stephen -> Brian -> Denise -> Bradley -> Shirley -> Janice -> Virginia -> Joan -> Kathryn -> Peter -> Susan -> Ethan -> Janet -> Brandon -> Karen -> Billy -> Victoria -> Alan -> Margaret -> Nicole -> Eric -> Jose -> Jacqueline -> Alexis -> Catherine -> Frances -> Aaron -> Ann -> Isabella -> Brenda -> Jonathan -> Lisa -> Justin -> Rachel -> Benjamin -> Gabriel -> Andrew -> Helen -> Anna -> Jacob -> Jack -> Judith -> Megan -> Joseph -> Natalie -> Barbara -> Julie -> Jesse\n\nNow, is there any common name in these two lists? For example, Arthur and Stephen, no; Sharon and Brian, no; Henry and Denise, no; Gregory and Bradley, no; Donald and Shirley, no; Doris and Janice, no; Alexander and Virginia, no; Madison and Joan, no; Walter and Kathryn, no; etc. No matches.\n\nTherefore, they don't share a common ancestor in this chain.\n\nBut perhaps there are other ancestors I missed.\n\nFor example, in Logan's chain, I have Keith, but Keith is not in the list I wrote; I stopped at Walter, but there are more.\n\nFor instance, Walter is Keith's descendant, so Keith is ancestor of Walter, thus of Logan.\n\nSimilarly, Keith is Mark's descendant, so Mark is ancestor of Keith, thus of Logan.\n\nMark is \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\nAlso, \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Keith is descendant of Mark\", but is there more for Mark?\n\n\"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Keith is descendant of Mark\", but I think \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" means Keith is descendant of Mark, so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\nThen \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" is the same.\n\nBut also, \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" so Keith is ancestor of Walter.\n\nThen Mark is ancestor of Keith, who is ancestor of Walter, so Mark is ancestor of Walter, thus of Logan.\n\nSimilarly, for Mary, I have more ancestors.\n\nBut in the lists, no common names.\n\nPerhaps through \"Jason\" or \"Benjamin\", but Benjamin is in Mary's chain, not in Logan's.\n\nBenjamin is \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor\" and \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\", so Gabriel is ancestor of Benjamin, thus of Rachel, Justin, etc., so of Mary.\n\nFor Logan, no Benjamin.\n\nBut Benjamin is also \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\" and Gabriel is \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor\", Andrew is \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor\" and \"Andrew is Helen's descendant\", etc.\n\nNot for Logan.\n\nAnother person: \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor\" and \"Andrew is Helen's descendant\", but for Logan, no Andrew.\n\nPerhaps \"Alexis\" or something.\n\nAlexis is \"Alexis is Jacqueline's ancestor\" and \"Alexis is Catherine's descendant\", so Catherine is ancestor of Alexis, thus of Jacqueline, Jose, etc., so of Mary.\n\nFor Logan, no Alexis.\n\nSo it seems no common ancestor in the chains.\n\nBut that can't be right; perhaps I missed a connection.\n\nLet's go back to the beginning of the problem.\n\n\"Given the following lineage relationships:\"\n\nThen a long list.\n\nPerhaps I can find if Mary and Logan are related through another person.\n\nFor example, is there a person who is descendant of both or something.\n\nBut that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps through \"Austin\" or \"Raymond\".\n\n\"Raymond is Lawrence's descendant\" so Lawrence is ancestor of Raymond.\n\n\"Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor\" so Ashley is ancestor of Lawrence, thus of Raymond.\n\n\"Raymond is Nicholas's ancestor\" so Nicholas is ancestor of Raymond, thus of Lawrence.\n\nBut not related to Mary or Logan.\n\n\"Lawrence is Raymond's descendant\" means Raymond is ancestor of Lawrence.\n\n\"Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor\" so Ashley is ancestor of Lawrence, thus of Raymond.\n\n\"Raymond is Nicholas's ancestor\" so Nicholas is ancestor of Raymond, so Raymond is descendant of Nicholas.\n\nSo Nicholas is ancestor of Raymond, who is ancestor of Lawrence, so Nicholas is ancestor of Lawrence.\n\nSimilarly, \"Nicholas is Judy's ancestor\" so Judy is descendant of Nicholas, thus descendant of Raymond and Lawrence.\n\nBut not helpful.\n\nPerhaps for Mary and Logan, they are not directly related, but let's look for any mention of both.\n\nFor example, is Logan mentioned in a way that connects to Mary?\n\nLogan is only \"Logan is Arthur's descendant\".\n\nMary is \"Mary is Martha's descendant\".\n\nNo other mentions.\n\nPerhaps through \"Bruce\" or other.\n\nBruce is Carl's ancestor and Bruce is Nancy's descendant, so Nancy is ancestor of Bruce.\n\n\"Carol is Bobby's descendant\" and \"Laura is Carol's descendant\", but Bobby is Debra's descendant, etc.\n\nNot related.\n\nI think I need to consider that the common ancestor might be far back.\n\nBut from the chains, the ancestors are different.\n\nUnless there is a person like \"Adam\" who is ancestor to many.\n\nAdam is Linda's ancestor, Linda is Ashley's ancestor, Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor, Lawrence is Raymond's descendant, Raymond is Nicholas's ancestor, Nicholas is Judy's ancestor, Judy is Nicholas's descendant? \"Nicholas is Judy's ancestor\" so Nicholas is ancestor of Judy.\n\nBut Judy is \"Daniel is Judy's descendant\" so Daniel is descendant of Judy.\n\nAlso, \"Nicholas is Judy's ancestor\" so Nicholas is ancestor of Judy, thus of Daniel.\n\nBut not related to Mary or Logan.\n\nMary's chain has many people, including Adam? No, Adam is not in Mary's chain.\n\nMary's chain has Jesse as an ancestor.\n\nJesse is \"Jesse is Sandra's descendant\" and \"Gerald is Sandra's ancestor\", but not Adam.\n\nSo Adam is not in Mary's chain.\n\nSimilarly, for Logan, Adam is not an ancestor.\n\nSo no common.\n\nPerhaps the common ancestor is not listed in the direct chains, but implied.\n\nBut I think I have to conclude that there is no common ancestor, so option 3 might not be true.\n\nBut let's check the options again.\n\nOption 1: Mary and Logan share a common descendant.\n\nThat would mean there is a person who is descendant of both Mary and Logan.\n\nFor example, if Mary has a child, and Logan has a child, and they are the same person, but that seems unlikely, as they are from different lines.\n\nIt is possible if they are cousins or something, but in this case, with the information, it's hard to say.\n\nFor instance, from the list, Mary has descendants? \"Mary is Martha's descendant\" so Mary has ancestors, but descendants are not mentioned, except that Martha is Mary's ancestor, so Martha may have descendants, but Mary is one.\n\nSimilarly, Logan has Arthur as ancestor, so Logan may have descendants, but not specified.\n\nSo it's possible that Mary and Logan share a common descendant, but I don't see evidence.\n\nFor example, is there a person who is descendant of both?\n\nFrom the list, I can see if there is a person who has both as ancestors.\n\nBut it's difficult to check all.\n\nPerhaps through \"Megan\" or something.\n\nMegan is \"Megan is Joseph's descendant\" and \"Judith is Megan's descendant\", so Judith is ancestor of Megan, etc.\n\nBut not Mary or Logan.\n\nAnother person: \"Joseph is Natalie's descendant\" so Natalie is ancestor of Joseph.\n\nNatalie is \"Barbara is Natalie's ancestor\", etc.\n\nBut not Logan.\n\nLogan's descendants are not listed.\n\nSo I think it's unlikely.\n\nPerhaps for option 4: Mary is Logan's ancestor.\n\nBut Mary is Martha's descendant, so if Mary is Logan's ancestor, then Logan would be descendant of Mary, but Mary is lower than Martha, so Martha would be ancestor of Logan, but Martha is not in Logan's chain.\n\nSimilarly, option 2: Mary is Logan's descendant, so Logan is ancestor of Mary, but Logan is descendant of Arthur, so Arthur would be ancestor of Mary, not the case.\n\nSo likely not.\n\nTherefore, option 5: none of the above.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nI recall that there is \"Logan is Arthur's descendant\" and \"Arthur is Sharon's descendant\", but also \"Henry is Sharon's ancestor\" and \"Henry is Gregory's descendant\", etc.\n\nBut for Mary, no.\n\nAnother thought: \"Bruce is Nancy's descendant\" and \"Elizabeth is Nancy's ancestor\", but Nancy is Bruce's ancestor? \"Bruce is Nancy's descendant\" so Nancy is ancestor of Bruce.\n\n\"Elizabeth is Nancy's ancestor\" so Elizabeth is ancestor of Nancy, thus of Bruce.\n\nBut not related.\n\nPerhaps \"Kevin\" or \"Carolyn\".\n\n\"Kevin is Carolyn's ancestor\" and \"Paul is Carolyn's descendant\", so Paul is descendant of Carolyn, thus of Kevin.\n\nBut not helpful.\n\nI think I have to go with none.\n\nBut let's look for the answer online or think differently.\n\nSince it's a puzzle, perhaps there is a connection through \"Benjamin\" or something.\n\nBenjamin is in Mary's chain.\n\nBenjamin is \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor\" and \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\".\n\nNow, is Benjamin in Logan's chain? No.\n\nBut Benjamin is also \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\" and Gabriel is \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor\", Andrew is \"Andrew is Helen's descendant\", Helen is \"Anna is Helen's ancestor\", Anna is \"Jacob is Anna's ancestor\", etc.\n\nFor Logan, no.\n\nPerhaps \"Walter\" and \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" and Keith is \"Keith is Mark's descendant\", Mark is \"Keith is Mark's descendant\", and Mark is also \"Mark is descendant of Theresa\"? \"Matthew is Teresa's ancestor\" not Mark.\n\n\"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Keith is descendant of Mark\", but Mark is not \"Mark\" in the list, only \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Mark\" might be short for Mark, but I think it's the same.\n\nPerhaps \"Terry\" or \"Christine\".\n\n\"Christine is Terry's descendant\" and \"Jordan is Christine's ancestor\", so Jordan is ancestor of Christine, thus of Terry.\n\nBut not Mary or Logan.\n\nI think I should accept that there is no direct relationship, so option 5.\n\nBut let's check the initial list for any direct link.\n\n\"Logan is Arthur's descendant\"\n\n\"Mary is Martha's descendant\"\n\nNo other mentions of Logan or Mary.\n\nSo probably they are not related, so none of the above.\n\nBut the question is to determine the relationship, and the options include \"share a common ancestor\" which might be true if they have a common ancestor not listed, but in the context, with the given information, it might not be.\n\nPerhaps through \"Austin\".\n\n\"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" and \"Austin is Kyle's descendant\", so Kyle is ancestor of Austin.\n\n\"Kyle is Katherine's descendant\" so Katherine is ancestor of Kyle, thus of Austin.\n\n\"Richard\" is \"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" so Richard is descendant of Austin.\n\n\"Raymond is Lawrence's descendant\" and \"Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor\", etc.\n\nNot related.\n\nAnother person: \"Raymond is Lawrence's descendant\" so Lawrence is ancestor of Raymond.\n\n\"Raymond is Nicholas's ancestor\" so Nicholas is ancestor of Raymond, so Raymond is descendant of Nicholas.\n\n\"Nicholas is Judy's ancestor\" so Judy is descendant of Nicholas.\n\n\"Judy is Nicholas's descendant\" same.\n\n\"Judy is Nicholas's descendant\" and \"Nicholas is Judy's ancestor\", consistent.\n\nBut Daniel is Judy's descendant, so Daniel is descendant of Judy, thus of Nicholas.\n\nBut not for Mary or Logan.\n\nI think I have to give up and choose option 5.\n\nBut let's see the answer choices; perhaps I missed something.\n\nMaybe Mary and Logan share a common ancestor through \"Henry\" or something.\n\nHenry is Sharon's ancestor, Sharon is Arthur's ancestor.\n\nHenry is Gregory's descendant, Gregory is Donald's descendant, etc.\n\nFor Mary, no Henry.\n\nBut \"Henry is Gregory's descendant\" and \"Gregory is Donald's descendant\", but Mary has Gregory? No.\n\nUnless \"Gregory\" is in Mary's chain, but in my list, for Mary, I have Bradley, not Gregory.\n\nBradley and Gregory are different.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps \"Shirley\" and \"Shirley is Bradley's ancestor\", but for Logan, no Shirley.\n\nI think it's impossible, so answer is 5.\n\nBut let's confirm with another way.\n\nPerhaps \"Austin\" is related.\n\nAustin is Richard's ancestor, Richard is Lauren is Richard's descendant, but Lauren is not in Mary's chain.\n\nMary's chain has Barbara, Natalie, etc.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: \"Patricia\" or \"Alice\".\n\n\"Alice is Patricia's descendant\" and \"Alice is Elizabeth's ancestor\", but Elizabeth is Nancy's ancestor, etc.\n\nNot related.\n\nI think I should go with 5.\n\nSo the answer is 5. None of the above.","reasoning_details":[{"id":"reasoning-text-1","format":"unknown","index":0,"type":"reasoning.text","text":"First, I need to determine the lineage relationship between Mary and Logan. The options are about whether they share a common descendant, if Mary is Logan's descendant, if they share a common ancestor, if Mary is Logan's ancestor, or none of the above.\n\nTo figure this out, I should trace the family tree based on the given relationships. Since there are many people, I need to focus on Mary and Logan and see how they connect through the lineage paths.\n\nLet me list out the relationships that directly or indirectly involve Mary or Logan.\n\nStarting with Logan: Logan is Arthur's descendant. From the list: \"Logan is Arthur's descendant.\"\n\nNow, Mary: I see \"Mary is Martha's descendant.\" So Mary is Martha's descendant.\n\nBut I need to connect them. Maybe through common ancestors or descendants.\n\nPerhaps I should find a path that links Mary and Logan through the relationships.\n\nSince Logan is Arthur's descendant, and Arthur might be connected to others, similarly for Mary.\n\nLet me try to build a tree or find connections.\n\nFirst, from the list:\n\n- Logan is Arthur's descendant. That means Arthur is Logan's ancestor, but not necessarily direct; it could be any ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, Mary is Martha's descendant, so Martha is Mary's ancestor.\n\nNow, I need to see if there's a common ancestor or something.\n\nOption 3 is \"Mary and Logan share a common ancestor,\" which might be possible.\n\nOption 2 is Mary is Logan's descendant, meaning Mary is a descendant of Logan, or Logan's descendant?\n\n\"Mary is Logan's descendant\" means Mary is a descendant of Logan, so Logan is an ancestor of Mary.\n\nSimilarly, \"Logan is Arthur's descendant\" means Logan is a descendant of Arthur, so Arthur is an ancestor of Logan.\n\nI should use \"descendant of\" to mean the person is lower in the tree, so if X is Y's descendant, then Y is an ancestor of X.\n\nFor example, Arthur is Sharon's descendant, so Arthur is a descendant of Sharon, meaning Sharon is Arthur's ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, Beverly is Melissa's ancestor, so Beverly is an ancestor of Melissa.\n\nBetty is Cheryl's ancestor, etc.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\n- If \"A is B's descendant\", then B is A's ancestor.\n\n- If \"A is B's ancestor\", then A is B's ancestor, so B is A's descendant.\n\nIn the phrasing: \"A is B's descendant\" means A is descendant of B, so B is ancestor of A.\n\n\"A is B's ancestor\" means A is ancestor of B, so B is descendant of A.\n\nNow for Mary and Logan.\n\nLogan is Arthur's descendant, so Arthur is ancestor of Logan.\n\nMary is Martha's descendant, so Martha is ancestor of Mary.\n\nBut I need to see if they connect.\n\nPerhaps I need to find if Arthur and Martha are related, or if there's a path.\n\nSince the relationships are given, I should start from Logan and go up, and from Mary and go up, to find a common point.\n\nLet me begin with Logan.\n\nLogan is Arthur's descendant. So, Arthur is ancestor of Logan.\n\nNow, what about Arthur? Is there information about Arthur's ancestors?\n\nArthur is Sharon's descendant, so Arthur is descendant of Sharon, meaning Sharon is Arthur's ancestor.\n\nSo Sharon is ancestor of Arthur, who is ancestor of Logan, so Sharon is ancestor of Logan.\n\nNow, is there more about Sharon?\n\nHenry is Sharon's ancestor. So Henry is ancestor of Sharon, so Henry is ancestor of Logan.\n\nSimilarly, Henry is Gregory's descendant. \"Henry is Gregory's descendant\" so Henry is descendant of Gregory, meaning Gregory is ancestor of Henry, and thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nGregory is Donald's descendant. \"Gregory is Donald's descendant\" so Donald is ancestor of Gregory, and thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nDonald is Doris's ancestor. \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" so Doris is ancestor of Donald, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nDoris is Alexander's descendant. \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\" so Alexander is ancestor of Doris, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nAlexander is Madison's descendant. \"Alexander is Madison's descendant\" so Madison is ancestor of Alexander, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nMadison? I need to see if that goes further.\n\nWalter is Madison's ancestor? \"Walter is Madison's ancestor\" so Walter is ancestor of Madison, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I might not need to go all the way; perhaps I can stop if I find Mary.\n\nNow for Mary.\n\nMary is Martha's descendant. So Martha is ancestor of Mary.\n\nWhat about Martha? I need to see Martha's ancestors.\n\nStephen is Martha's ancestor. \"Stephen is Brian's descendant\" – no.\n\n\"Stephen is Brian's descendant\" so Stephen is descendant of Brian, meaning Brian is ancestor of Stephen.\n\nBut I need Martha.\n\nMartha is mentioned: \"Mary is Martha's descendant\" and \"Stephen is Martha's ancestor\" – Stephen is Martha's ancestor, so Martha is descendant of Stephen.\n\n\"Stephen is Martha's ancestor\" so Stephen is ancestor of Martha, thus ancestor of Mary.\n\nStephen is Brian's descendant, so Brian is ancestor of Stephen, thus ancestor of Martha, thus ancestor of Mary.\n\nBrian is... let's see.\n\n\"Denise is Brian's ancestor\" – \"Denise is Bradley's descendant\" and \"Denise is Brian's ancestor\" – I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me list all mentions of Martha and Mary.\n\nMary: \"Mary is Martha's descendant.\"\n\nMartha: \"Stephen is Martha's ancestor.\" \"Stephen is Brian's descendant.\"\n\nAlso, \"Mary is Martha's descendant\" and \"Martha is descendant of Stephen.\"\n\nStephen: \"Stephen is Brian's descendant.\" \"Stephen is Martha's ancestor.\"\n\nBrian: \"Denise is Brian's ancestor.\" \"Stephen is Brian's

Aaron's descendant.\"\n\nAaron: \"Frances is Aaron's descendant\" and \"Aaron is Ann's descendant.\"\n\nAnn: \"Aaron is Ann's descendant\" and \"Ann is Isabella's descendant.\"\n\nIsabella: \"Ann is Isabella's descendant\" and \"Brenda is Isabella's ancestor.\"\n\nBrenda: \"Brenda is Isabella's ancestor\" and \"Brenda is Jonathan's descendant.\"\n\nJonathan: \"Brenda is Jonathan's descendant\" and \"Lisa is Jonathan's ancestor.\"\n\nLisa: \"Lisa is Jonathan's ancestor\" and \"Justin is Lisa's ancestor.\"\n\nJustin: \"Justin is Lisa's ancestor\" and \"Rachel is Justin's ancestor.\"\n\nRachel: \"Rachel is Justin's ancestor\" and \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor.\"\n\nBenjamin: \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor\" and \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant.\"\n\nGabriel: \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\" and \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor.\"\n\nAndrew: \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor\" and \"Andrew is Helen's descendant.\"\n\nHelen: \"Andrew is Helen's descendant\" and \"Anna is Helen's ancestor.\"\n\nAnna: \"Anna is Helen's ancestor\" and \"Jacob is Anna's ancestor.\"\n\nJacob: \"Jacob is Anna's ancestor\" and \"Jack is Jacob's ancestor.\"\n\nJack: \"Jack is Jacob's ancestor\" and \"Jack is Judith's descendant.\"\n\nJudith: \"Jack is Judith's descendant\" and \"Judith is Megan's descendant.\"\n\nMegan: \"Judith is Megan's descendant\" and \"Megan is Joseph's descendant.\"\n\nJoseph: \"Megan is Joseph's descendant\" and \"Joseph is Natalie's descendant.\"\n\nNatalie: \"Joseph is Natalie's descendant\" and \"Barbara is Natalie's ancestor.\"\n\nBarbara: \"Barbara is Natalie's ancestor\" and \"Julie is Barbara's ancestor.\"\n\nJulie: \"Julie is Barbara's ancestor\" and \"Jesse is Julie's ancestor.\"\n\nJesse: \"Jesse is Julie's ancestor\" and \"Gerald is Sandra's ancestor\" and \"Jesse is Sandra's descendant\" – I think I have a loop or something.\n\nJesse is Sandra's descendant, but also Jesse is Julie's ancestor? Not consistent.\n\n\"Jesse is Julie's ancestor\" and \"Jesse is Sandra's descendant\" – so if Jesse is Sandra's descendant, Sandra is ancestor of Jesse, but if Jesse is Julie's ancestor, Jesse is ancestor of Julie, so Sandra could be ancestor of Julie or something.\n\nBut let's not digress; I was tracing Mary to her ancestors.\n\nFrom Mary down to Martha to Stephen to Brian to Denise to Bradley to Shirley to Janice to Virginia to Joan to Kathryn to Peter to Susan to Ethan to Janet to Brandon to Karen to Billy to Victoria to Alan to Margaret to Nicole to Eric to Jose to Jacqueline to Alexis to Catherine to Frances to Aaron to Ann to Isabella to Brenda to Jonathan to Lisa to Justin to Rachel to Benjamin to Gabriel to Andrew to Helen to Anna to Jacob to Jack to Judith to Megan to Joseph to Natalie to Barbara to Julie to Jesse.\n\nBut Jesse is also connected to Sandra, but I think for Mary, I have a chain.\n\nBut this is getting long, and I might have made a mistake because it's circular or something. Let's simplify.\n\nSince Mary is Martha's descendant, and Martha is descendant of Stephen, etc., but for Logan, I have a different chain.\n\nLogan is Arthur's descendant, Arthur is Sharon's descendant, Sharon is descendant of Henry, Henry is Gregory's descendant, Gregory is Donald's descendant, Donald is Doris's ancestor? \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" so Doris is ancestor of Donald.\n\n\"Gregory is Donald's descendant\" so Donald is ancestor of Gregory.\n\nDoris is Donald's ancestor, so Doris is ancestor of Gregory? Let's see:\n\n- Donald is ancestor of Gregory (since Gregory is Donald's descendant)\n\n- Doris is ancestor of Donald (since Doris is Donald's ancestor)\n\nSo Doris is ancestor of Donald, who is ancestor of Gregory, so Doris is ancestor of Gregory, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nDoris is Alexander's descendant, so Alexander is ancestor of Doris, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nAlexander is Madison's descendant, so Madison is ancestor of Alexander, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nWalter is Madison's ancestor, so Walter is ancestor of Madison, thus ancestor of Logan.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, for Mary, from above, I have a long chain, but I need to see if any of these ancestors match or if there's a common point.\n\nPerhaps Mary and Logan share a common ancestor through Martha and Arthur or something.\n\nBut let's look for a direct link or a shorter path.\n\nI recall that there is \"Laura is Carol's descendant\" and \"Carol is Bobby's descendant\", but not sure.\n\nAnother thing: there is \"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" and \"Lauren is Richard's descendant\", etc.\n\nBut let's think about the options. Option 3 is \"Mary and Logan share a common ancestor.\" That might be true.\n\nBut let's see if I can find that common ancestor.\n\nPerhaps from the list, I can find if Arthur and Martha are related.\n\nArthur and Martha don't seem directly related, but their ancestors might be.\n\nLet's list the ancestors of Logan and Mary and see if there's overlap.\n\nFirst, Logan:\n\n- Logan is Arthur's descendant → Arthur is ancestor\n\n- Arthur is Sharon's descendant → Sharon is ancestor\n\n- Sharon is descendant of Henry? \"Henry is Sharon's ancestor\" so Henry is ancestor of Sharon, thus of Arthur and Logan.\n\n- Henry is Gregory's descendant → Gregory is ancestor of Henry, thus of Logan\n\n- Gregory is Donald's descendant → Donald is ancestor of Gregory, thus of Logan\n\n- Donald is Doris's ancestor → Doris is ancestor of Donald, thus of Logan\n\n- Doris is Alexander's descendant → Alexander is ancestor of Doris, thus of Logan\n\n- Alexander is Madison's descendant → Madison is ancestor of Alexander, thus of Logan\n\n- Walter is Madison's ancestor → Walter is ancestor of Madison, thus of Logan\n\nNow for Mary:\n\n- Mary is Martha's descendant → Martha is ancestor\n\n- Martha is descendant of Stephen → Stephen is ancestor\n\n- Stephen is Brian's descendant → Brian is ancestor\n\n- Denise is Brian's ancestor → Denise is ancestor of Brian, thus of Stephen and Mary\n\n- Denise is Bradley's descendant → Bradley is ancestor of Denise, thus of Brian, Stephen, Mary\n\n- Shirley is Bradley's ancestor → Shirley is ancestor of Bradley, thus of Denise, Brian, Stephen, Mary\n\n- Janice is Shirley's ancestor → Janice is ancestor of Shirley, thus of all above\n\n- Virginia is Janice's ancestor → Virginia is ancestor of Janice, thus of all above\n\n- Virginia is Joan's descendant → Joan is ancestor of Virginia, thus of Janice, Shirley, etc., so ancestor of Mary\n\n- Joan is Kathryn's descendant → Kathryn is ancestor of Joan, thus of Virginia, Janice, etc.\n\n- Peter is Kathryn's ancestor → Peter is ancestor of Kathryn, thus of Joan, Virginia, etc.\n\n- Susan is Peter's ancestor → Susan is ancestor of Peter, thus of Kathryn, Joan, etc.\n\n- Ethan is Susan's ancestor → Ethan is ancestor of Susan, thus of Peter, Kathryn, etc.\n\n- Ethan is Janet's descendant → Janet is ancestor of Ethan, thus of Susan, Peter, etc.\n\n- Janet is Brandon's descendant → Brandon is ancestor of Janet, thus of Ethan, Susan, etc.\n\n- Brandon is Karen's descendant → Karen is ancestor of Brandon, thus of Janet, Ethan, etc.\n\n- Karen is Billy's descendant → Billy is ancestor of Karen, thus of Brandon, Janet, etc.\n\n- Victoria is Billy's ancestor → Victoria is ancestor of Billy, thus of Karen, Brandon, etc.\n\n- Victoria is Alan's descendant → Alan is ancestor of Victoria, thus of Billy, Karen, etc.\n\n- Margaret is Alan's ancestor → Margaret is ancestor of Alan, thus of Victoria, Billy, etc.\n\n- Margaret is Nicole's descendant → Nicole is ancestor of Margaret, thus of Alan, Victoria, etc.\n\n- Eric is Nicole's ancestor → Eric is ancestor of Nicole, thus of Margaret, Alan, etc.\n\n- Jose is Eric's ancestor → Jose is ancestor of Eric, thus of Nicole, Margaret, etc.\n\n- Jacqueline is Jose's ancestor → Jacqueline is ancestor of Jose, thus of Eric, Nicole, etc.\n\n- Alexis is Jacqueline's ancestor → Alexis is ancestor of Jacqueline, thus of Jose, Eric, etc.\n\n- Alexis is Catherine's descendant → Catherine is ancestor of Alexis, thus of Jacqueline, Jose, etc.\n\n- Frances is Catherine's ancestor → Frances is ancestor of Catherine, thus of Alexis, Jacqueline, etc.\n\n- Frances is Aaron's descendant → Aaron is ancestor of Frances, thus of Catherine, Alexis, etc.\n\n- Aaron is Ann's descendant → Ann is ancestor of Aaron, thus of Frances, Catherine, etc.\n\n- Ann is Isabella's descendant → Isabella is ancestor of Ann, thus of Aaron, Frances, etc.\n\n- Brenda is Isabella's ancestor → Brenda is ancestor of Isabella, thus of Ann, Aaron, etc.\n\n- Brenda is Jonathan's descendant → Jonathan is ancestor of Brenda, thus of Isabella, Ann, etc.\n\n- Lisa is Jonathan's ancestor → Lisa is ancestor of Jonathan, thus of Brenda, Isabella, etc.\n\n- Justin is Lisa's ancestor → Justin is ancestor of Lisa, thus of Jonathan, Brenda, etc.\n\n- Rachel is Justin's ancestor → Rachel is ancestor of Justin, thus of Lisa, Jonathan, etc.\n\n- Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor → Benjamin is ancestor of Rachel, thus of Justin, Lisa, etc.\n\n- Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant → Gabriel is ancestor of Benjamin, thus of Rachel, Justin, etc.\n\n- Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor → Andrew is ancestor of Gabriel, thus of Benjamin, Rachel, etc.\n\n- Andrew is Helen's descendant → Helen is ancestor of Andrew, thus of Gabriel, Benjamin, etc.\n\n- Anna is Helen's ancestor → Anna is ancestor of Helen, thus of Andrew, Gabriel, etc.\n\n- Jacob is Anna's ancestor → Jacob is ancestor of Anna, thus of Helen, Andrew, etc.\n\n- Jack is Jacob's ancestor → Jack is ancestor of Jacob, thus of Anna, Helen, etc.\n\n- Jack is Judith's descendant → Judith is ancestor of Jack, thus of Jacob, Anna, etc.\n\n- Judith is Megan's descendant → Megan is ancestor of Judith, thus of Jack, Jacob, etc.\n\n- Megan is Joseph's descendant → Joseph is ancestor of Megan, thus of Judith, Jack, etc.\n\n- Joseph is Natalie's descendant → Natalie is ancestor of Joseph, thus of Megan, Judith, etc.\n\n- Barbara is Natalie's ancestor → Barbara is ancestor of Natalie, thus of Joseph, Megan, etc.\n\n- Julie is Barbara's ancestor → Julie is ancestor of Barbara, thus of Natalie, Joseph, etc.\n\n- Jesse is Julie's ancestor → Jesse is ancestor of Julie, thus of Barbara, Natalie, etc.\n\nJesse is also mentioned elsewhere, but for Mary, this is the ancestor chain.\n\nNow, for Logan, I had Walter as an ancestor.\n\nWalter: \"Walter is Madison's ancestor\" and \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" but Keith is Mark's descendant, etc.\n\nAlso, \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\n\"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\n\"Walter is Madison's ancestor\" and \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" so Keith is ancestor of Walter? \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" means Walter is descendant of Keith, so Keith is ancestor of Walter.\n\nBut \"Walter is Madison's ancestor\" so Walter is ancestor of Madison.\n\nSo Keith is ancestor of Walter, who is ancestor of Madison, so Keith is ancestor of Madison.\n\nThen Madison is ancestor of Alexander, etc.\n\nBut for Mary, I don't see Madison or Keith in her chain.\n\nMary's chain has many people, but let's see if any of Logan's ancestors appear in Mary's chain.\n\nFor example, is Walter in Mary's chain? I don't think so.\n\nSimilarly, is Jesse in Logan's chain? No.\n\nPerhaps there is a common ancestor higher up.\n\nBut in the options, it might be easier to see if Mary is Logan's descendant or vice versa.\n\n\"Mary is Logan's descendant\" would mean Logan is ancestor of Mary.\n\n\"Logan is Arthur's descendant\" so Arthur is ancestor of Logan, not Mary.\n\nUnless Arthur is ancestor of Mary, but I don't see that.\n\nSimilarly, Martha is ancestor of Mary, but not Logan.\n\nSo probably not directly descendant.\n\nBut option 1 is \"share a common descendant\" which might mean that they have a common child or grandchild, but that seems unlikely since they are in different lines.\n\nOption 2: Mary is Logan's descendant, meaning Mary is descendant of Logan, so Logan is ancestor of Mary.\n\nBut from the chains, Logan is descendant of Arthur, Mary is descendant of Martha, no direct link.\n\nOption 4: Mary is Logan's ancestor, so Mary is ancestor of Logan, meaning Logan is descendant of Mary.\n\nBut Mary is Martha's descendant, so if Mary is ancestor of Logan, that would mean Mary is between Martha and Logan, but Martha and Logan have no direct link.\n\nSo likely not.\n\nOption 3: share a common ancestor.\n\nTo find a common ancestor, I need to find a person who is ancestor of both Mary and Logan.\n\nFrom Mary's chain, the ultimate ancestor I have is Jesse, but Jesse is ancestor of Mary.\n\nFor Logan, Walter is ancestor.\n\nBut Walter and Jesse are different.\n\nPerhaps there is someone above.\n\nFor example, in Logan's chain, I have Doris, who is ancestor of Logan.\n\nDoris is Alexander's descendant, so Alexander is ancestor of Doris.\n\nAlexander is Madison's descendant, Madison is Walter's descendant, etc.\n\nBut Alexander might be in Mary's chain? I don't think so.\n\nLet's check if Alexander is mentioned in Mary's chain.\n\nIn Mary's chain, I have people like Alan, Margaret, Eric, Jose, etc.\n\nAlexander is not there.\n\nSimilarly, for Mary, I have Jesse.\n\nJesse is Sandra's ancestor? \"Jesse is Sandra's ancestor\" and \"Gerald is Sandra's ancestor\" but not related to Logan.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps through the \"descendant\" and \"ancestor\" we can find if they are connected.\n\nI recall that there is \"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" and \"Lauren is Richard's descendant\", but not sure.\n\nLet's list all relationships involving Logan or Mary directly.\n\nFor Logan: Logan is Arthur's descendant. That's it? No other direct for Logan.\n\nThe list has \"Logan is Arthur's descendant\" only.\n\nFor Mary: \"Mary is Martha's descendant.\"\n\nNow, I need to connect Arthur and Martha or their ancestors.\n\nPerhaps Arthur and Martha share a common ancestor through other people.\n\nBut that might be hard.\n\nAnother thought: look for a person who is ancestor to both.\n\nFor example, from the list, there is \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor\" and \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\" but not related.\n\nPerhaps I can use the fact that some people are connected through multiple paths.\n\nFor instance, \"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" and \"Austin is Kyle's descendant\" so Kyle is ancestor of Austin.\n\nBut not helpful.\n\nLet's notice that there is \"Gerald is Sandra's ancestor\" and \"Jesse is Sandra's descendant\" so Sandra is descendant of Jesse.\n\nBut not related.\n\nPerhaps Mary and Logan are both descendants of the same person.\n\nBut who?\n\nLet's think about the beginning of the chains.\n\nFor Logan, his ancestor chain has people like Arthur, Sharon, Henry, Gregory, Donald, Doris, Alexander, Madison, Walter, Keith, Mark, etc.\n\nFor Mary, ancestor chain has Martha, Stephen, Brian, Denise, Bradley, Shirley, Janice, Virginia, Joan, Kathryn, Peter, Susan, Ethan, Janet, Brandon, Karen, Billy, Victoria, Alan, Margaret, Nicole, Eric, Jose, Jacqueline, Alexis, Catherine, Frances, Aaron, Ann, Isabella, Brenda, Jonathan, Lisa, Justin, Rachel, Benjamin, Gabriel, Andrew, Helen, Anna, Jacob, Jack, Judith, Megan, Joseph, Natalie, Barbara, Julie, Jesse.\n\nNow, is there any overlap between these two lists? For example, is Walter in the first list and in the second? No.\n\nIs Jesse in the second and in the first? No.\n\nPerhaps a common ancestor like Adam or someone.\n\nAdam is Linda's ancestor, Linda is Ashley's ancestor, Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor, Lawrence is Raymond's descendant, Raymond is Nicholas's ancestor, etc.\n\nBut not connected to either.\n\nAnother person: \"Diana is Robert's ancestor\" and \"Robert is Brittany's ancestor\", but not related.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that some ancestors are the same.\n\nLet's search for a person who is ancestor to both.\n\nFor example, is there a person like Margaret or Alan who might be in both.\n\nAlan is in Mary's chain, but for Logan, no Alan.\n\nSimilarly, Victoria is in Mary's chain, but for Logan, no Victoria.\n\nPerhaps from the descendant side.\n\n\"Mary and Logan share a common descendant\" – that would mean they have a common child or something, but since they are descendants, they might have descendants, but it's less likely to be the same person.\n\nFor example, Mary has descendants, Logan has descendants, but it's possible they share a descendant if they are in the same line, but here they are from different lines.\n\nSo probably not.\n\nUnless there is a mistake.\n\nLet's look for a direct connection between the chains.\n\nFor instance, in Logan's chain, I have Keith.\n\nKeith is Mark's descendant, Mark is Keith's descendant? \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\n\"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\nThen Keith is Walter's descendant? \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" so Walter is descendant of Keith, so Keith is ancestor of Walter.\n\n\"Walter is Madison's ancestor\" and \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" so Keith is ancestor of Walter.\n\nThen Walter is ancestor of Madison, etc.\n\nNow, in Mary's chain, is there Keith? No.\n\nAnother person: in Logan's chain, Doris is ancestor.\n\nDoris is Donald's ancestor, Donald is Gregory's ancestor.\n\nDoris is Alexander's descendant, Alexander is Madison's descendant.\n\nBut for Mary, Doris is not there.\n\nBut Doris is also \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" and \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\", but also \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\" and \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\", which is consistent, but Doris is not in Mary's chain.\n\nHowever, Doris is \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" and \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\", but I think I have a duplication.\n\n\"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" means Doris is ancestor of Donald.\n\n\"Gregory is Donald's descendant\" so Donald is ancestor of Gregory.\n\nSo Doris is ancestor of Donald, who is ancestor of Gregory, so Doris is ancestor of Gregory.\n\nSimilarly, \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\" so Alexander is ancestor of Doris.\n\nSo Alexander is ancestor of Doris, who is ancestor of Donald, who is ancestor of Gregory, so Alexander is ancestor of Gregory.\n\nFor Mary, Alexander is not in her chain.\n\nBut Alexander is in Logan's chain as ancestor.\n\nMary's chain has Jesse as the ultimate.\n\nJesse is \"Jesse is Sandra's descendant\" and \"Gerald is Sandra's ancestor\", but not related.\n\nPerhaps there is a common ancestor through other means.\n\nLet's list all people who are ancestors to Logan.\n\nFrom above: Arthur, Sharon, Henry, Gregory, Donald, Doris, Alexander, Madison, Walter, Keith, Mark, and others like if I go further.\n\nKeith is Mark's descendant, so Mark is ancestor.\n\nMark is \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\nMark is also \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Mark is descendant of Theresa\"? \"Matthew is Teresa's ancestor\" not Mark.\n\n\"Mark\" is mentioned: \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Keith is Mark's descendant\", that's it? No.\n\n\"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\nAlso, \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" so Keith is ancestor of Walter.\n\nBut Mark is not necessarily ancestor of Walter unless connected.\n\nSimilarly, for Mary, her ancestors include many.\n\nBut let's notice that in Logan's chain, there is Keith, and in Mary's chain, there is Keith? No.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"Benjamin\" is in both.\n\nBenjamin is Rachel's ancestor, and Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant.\n\nFor Logan, no Benjamin.\n\nBut Benjamin is also \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\" and \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor\", but Gabriel is in both chains? No.\n\nGabriel is in Mary's chain as ancestor of Benjamin.\n\nIn Logan's chain, no Gabriel.\n\nHowever, for Logan, there is \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" and Keith is Mark's descendant, but not Gabriel.\n\nPerhaps I need to see if there is a person like Victoria or Alan who is ancestor to both.\n\nAlan is in Mary's chain, and for Logan, Alan is not an ancestor.\n\nBut Alan is \"Victoria is Alan's descendant\" and \"Margaret is Alan's ancestor\", etc.\n\nNot for Logan.\n\nLet's check if Logan has an ancestor named Alan. No.\n\nSimilarly, Victoria is not in Logan's chain.\n\nBut Victoria is \"Victoria is Billy's ancestor\" and \"Victoria is Alan's descendant\", but Billy is in Mary's chain.\n\nFor Logan, Billy is not an ancestor.\n\nPerhaps through \"Austin\" or something.\n\nI recall that there is \"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" and \"Austin is Kyle's descendant\", but Richard is also \"Lauren is Richard's descendant\", but not related.\n\nAnother person: \"Raymond is Lawrence's descendant\" and \"Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor\", but Ashley is Linda's ancestor, Linda is Adam's ancestor, etc.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nPerhaps I can consider that some relationships imply a common ancestor.\n\nFor example, if A is B's ancestor and B is C's ancestor, then A is ancestor of C.\n\nBut for Mary and Logan, they are from different roots.\n\nLet's look for a person who is mentioned as ancestor to someone in both chains.\n\nFor example, is there a person P such that P is ancestor of Mary and P is ancestor of Logan.\n\nFrom Mary's chain, P could be Jesse, for example.\n\nIs Jesse ancestor of Logan? I don't see that.\n\nSimilarly, for Logan, P could be Walter.\n\nIs Walter ancestor of Mary? No.\n\nPerhaps P is not direct, but through a chain.\n\nBut Jesse and Walter are not connected.\n\nUnless there is a person like Margaret who is in both, but Margaret is only in Mary's chain.\n\nMargaret is \"Margaret is Alan's ancestor\" and \"Margaret is Nicole's descendant\", so Nicole is ancestor of Margaret, thus of Alan, Victoria, etc., so of Mary.\n\nFor Logan, Nicole is not an ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, for Logan, we have people like Doris, who is \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" and \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\", but not for Mary.\n\nBut Doris is also \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\" and \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\", and \"Doris is Alexander's descendant\" means Alexander is ancestor of Doris, and \"Doris is Donald's ancestor\" so Doris is ancestor of Donald.\n\nSo Doris is between Alexander and Donald.\n\nBut Alexander is ancestor of Doris, Doris is ancestor of Donald, so Alexander is ancestor of Donald.\n\nFor Mary, Alexander is not an ancestor.\n\nHowever, Alexander is \"Alexander is Madison's descendant\" and Madison is \"Walter is Madison's ancestor\", so Walter is ancestor of Madison, who is ancestor of Alexander, who is ancestor of Doris, etc.\n\nBut for Mary, no Madison.\n\nBut Mary has \"Alexander\" in her chain? No, Alexander is not in Mary's chain.\n\nIn Mary's chain, I have people like Alan, but Alan is different.\n\nLet's list the first few ancestors of Mary and Logan.\n\nFor Logan: Arthur -> Sharon -> Henry -> Gregory -> Donald -> Doris -> Alexander -> Madison -> Walter\n\nFor Mary: Martha -> Stephen -> Brian -> Denise -> Bradley -> Shirley -> Janice -> Virginia -> Joan -> Kathryn -> Peter -> Susan -> Ethan -> Janet -> Brandon -> Karen -> Billy -> Victoria -> Alan -> Margaret -> Nicole -> Eric -> Jose -> Jacqueline -> Alexis -> Catherine -> Frances -> Aaron -> Ann -> Isabella -> Brenda -> Jonathan -> Lisa -> Justin -> Rachel -> Benjamin -> Gabriel -> Andrew -> Helen -> Anna -> Jacob -> Jack -> Judith -> Megan -> Joseph -> Natalie -> Barbara -> Julie -> Jesse\n\nNow, is there any common name in these two lists? For example, Arthur and Stephen, no; Sharon and Brian, no; Henry and Denise, no; Gregory and Bradley, no; Donald and Shirley, no; Doris and Janice, no; Alexander and Virginia, no; Madison and Joan, no; Walter and Kathryn, no; etc. No matches.\n\nTherefore, they don't share a common ancestor in this chain.\n\nBut perhaps there are other ancestors I missed.\n\nFor example, in Logan's chain, I have Keith, but Keith is not in the list I wrote; I stopped at Walter, but there are more.\n\nFor instance, Walter is Keith's descendant, so Keith is ancestor of Walter, thus of Logan.\n\nSimilarly, Keith is Mark's descendant, so Mark is ancestor of Keith, thus of Logan.\n\nMark is \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\nAlso, \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Keith is descendant of Mark\", but is there more for Mark?\n\n\"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Keith is descendant of Mark\", but I think \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" means Keith is descendant of Mark, so Mark is ancestor of Keith.\n\nThen \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" is the same.\n\nBut also, \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" so Keith is ancestor of Walter.\n\nThen Mark is ancestor of Keith, who is ancestor of Walter, so Mark is ancestor of Walter, thus of Logan.\n\nSimilarly, for Mary, I have more ancestors.\n\nBut in the lists, no common names.\n\nPerhaps through \"Jason\" or \"Benjamin\", but Benjamin is in Mary's chain, not in Logan's.\n\nBenjamin is \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor\" and \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\", so Gabriel is ancestor of Benjamin, thus of Rachel, Justin, etc., so of Mary.\n\nFor Logan, no Benjamin.\n\nBut Benjamin is also \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\" and Gabriel is \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor\", Andrew is \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor\" and \"Andrew is Helen's descendant\", etc.\n\nNot for Logan.\n\nAnother person: \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor\" and \"Andrew is Helen's descendant\", but for Logan, no Andrew.\n\nPerhaps \"Alexis\" or something.\n\nAlexis is \"Alexis is Jacqueline's ancestor\" and \"Alexis is Catherine's descendant\", so Catherine is ancestor of Alexis, thus of Jacqueline, Jose, etc., so of Mary.\n\nFor Logan, no Alexis.\n\nSo it seems no common ancestor in the chains.\n\nBut that can't be right; perhaps I missed a connection.\n\nLet's go back to the beginning of the problem.\n\n\"Given the following lineage relationships:\"\n\nThen a long list.\n\nPerhaps I can find if Mary and Logan are related through another person.\n\nFor example, is there a person who is descendant of both or something.\n\nBut that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps through \"Austin\" or \"Raymond\".\n\n\"Raymond is Lawrence's descendant\" so Lawrence is ancestor of Raymond.\n\n\"Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor\" so Ashley is ancestor of Lawrence, thus of Raymond.\n\n\"Raymond is Nicholas's ancestor\" so Nicholas is ancestor of Raymond, thus of Lawrence.\n\nBut not related to Mary or Logan.\n\n\"Lawrence is Raymond's descendant\" means Raymond is ancestor of Lawrence.\n\n\"Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor\" so Ashley is ancestor of Lawrence, thus of Raymond.\n\n\"Raymond is Nicholas's ancestor\" so Nicholas is ancestor of Raymond, so Raymond is descendant of Nicholas.\n\nSo Nicholas is ancestor of Raymond, who is ancestor of Lawrence, so Nicholas is ancestor of Lawrence.\n\nSimilarly, \"Nicholas is Judy's ancestor\" so Judy is descendant of Nicholas, thus descendant of Raymond and Lawrence.\n\nBut not helpful.\n\nPerhaps for Mary and Logan, they are not directly related, but let's look for any mention of both.\n\nFor example, is Logan mentioned in a way that connects to Mary?\n\nLogan is only \"Logan is Arthur's descendant\".\n\nMary is \"Mary is Martha's descendant\".\n\nNo other mentions.\n\nPerhaps through \"Bruce\" or other.\n\nBruce is Carl's ancestor and Bruce is Nancy's descendant, so Nancy is ancestor of Bruce.\n\n\"Carol is Bobby's descendant\" and \"Laura is Carol's descendant\", but Bobby is Debra's descendant, etc.\n\nNot related.\n\nI think I need to consider that the common ancestor might be far back.\n\nBut from the chains, the ancestors are different.\n\nUnless there is a person like \"Adam\" who is ancestor to many.\n\nAdam is Linda's ancestor, Linda is Ashley's ancestor, Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor, Lawrence is Raymond's descendant, Raymond is Nicholas's ancestor, Nicholas is Judy's ancestor, Judy is Nicholas's descendant? \"Nicholas is Judy's ancestor\" so Nicholas is ancestor of Judy.\n\nBut Judy is \"Daniel is Judy's descendant\" so Daniel is descendant of Judy.\n\nAlso, \"Nicholas is Judy's ancestor\" so Nicholas is ancestor of Judy, thus of Daniel.\n\nBut not related to Mary or Logan.\n\nMary's chain has many people, including Adam? No, Adam is not in Mary's chain.\n\nMary's chain has Jesse as an ancestor.\n\nJesse is \"Jesse is Sandra's descendant\" and \"Gerald is Sandra's ancestor\", but not Adam.\n\nSo Adam is not in Mary's chain.\n\nSimilarly, for Logan, Adam is not an ancestor.\n\nSo no common.\n\nPerhaps the common ancestor is not listed in the direct chains, but implied.\n\nBut I think I have to conclude that there is no common ancestor, so option 3 might not be true.\n\nBut let's check the options again.\n\nOption 1: Mary and Logan share a common descendant.\n\nThat would mean there is a person who is descendant of both Mary and Logan.\n\nFor example, if Mary has a child, and Logan has a child, and they are the same person, but that seems unlikely, as they are from different lines.\n\nIt is possible if they are cousins or something, but in this case, with the information, it's hard to say.\n\nFor instance, from the list, Mary has descendants? \"Mary is Martha's descendant\" so Mary has ancestors, but descendants are not mentioned, except that Martha is Mary's ancestor, so Martha may have descendants, but Mary is one.\n\nSimilarly, Logan has Arthur as ancestor, so Logan may have descendants, but not specified.\n\nSo it's possible that Mary and Logan share a common descendant, but I don't see evidence.\n\nFor example, is there a person who is descendant of both?\n\nFrom the list, I can see if there is a person who has both as ancestors.\n\nBut it's difficult to check all.\n\nPerhaps through \"Megan\" or something.\n\nMegan is \"Megan is Joseph's descendant\" and \"Judith is Megan's descendant\", so Judith is ancestor of Megan, etc.\n\nBut not Mary or Logan.\n\nAnother person: \"Joseph is Natalie's descendant\" so Natalie is ancestor of Joseph.\n\nNatalie is \"Barbara is Natalie's ancestor\", etc.\n\nBut not Logan.\n\nLogan's descendants are not listed.\n\nSo I think it's unlikely.\n\nPerhaps for option 4: Mary is Logan's ancestor.\n\nBut Mary is Martha's descendant, so if Mary is Logan's ancestor, then Logan would be descendant of Mary, but Mary is lower than Martha, so Martha would be ancestor of Logan, but Martha is not in Logan's chain.\n\nSimilarly, option 2: Mary is Logan's descendant, so Logan is ancestor of Mary, but Logan is descendant of Arthur, so Arthur would be ancestor of Mary, not the case.\n\nSo likely not.\n\nTherefore, option 5: none of the above.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nI recall that there is \"Logan is Arthur's descendant\" and \"Arthur is Sharon's descendant\", but also \"Henry is Sharon's ancestor\" and \"Henry is Gregory's descendant\", etc.\n\nBut for Mary, no.\n\nAnother thought: \"Bruce is Nancy's descendant\" and \"Elizabeth is Nancy's ancestor\", but Nancy is Bruce's ancestor? \"Bruce is Nancy's descendant\" so Nancy is ancestor of Bruce.\n\n\"Elizabeth is Nancy's ancestor\" so Elizabeth is ancestor of Nancy, thus of Bruce.\n\nBut not related.\n\nPerhaps \"Kevin\" or \"Carolyn\".\n\n\"Kevin is Carolyn's ancestor\" and \"Paul is Carolyn's descendant\", so Paul is descendant of Carolyn, thus of Kevin.\n\nBut not helpful.\n\nI think I have to go with none.\n\nBut let's look for the answer online or think differently.\n\nSince it's a puzzle, perhaps there is a connection through \"Benjamin\" or something.\n\nBenjamin is in Mary's chain.\n\nBenjamin is \"Benjamin is Rachel's ancestor\" and \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\".\n\nNow, is Benjamin in Logan's chain? No.\n\nBut Benjamin is also \"Benjamin is Gabriel's descendant\" and Gabriel is \"Andrew is Gabriel's ancestor\", Andrew is \"Andrew is Helen's descendant\", Helen is \"Anna is Helen's ancestor\", Anna is \"Jacob is Anna's ancestor\", etc.\n\nFor Logan, no.\n\nPerhaps \"Walter\" and \"Walter is Keith's descendant\" and Keith is \"Keith is Mark's descendant\", Mark is \"Keith is Mark's descendant\", and Mark is also \"Mark is descendant of Theresa\"? \"Matthew is Teresa's ancestor\" not Mark.\n\n\"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Keith is descendant of Mark\", but Mark is not \"Mark\" in the list, only \"Keith is Mark's descendant\" and \"Mark\" might be short for Mark, but I think it's the same.\n\nPerhaps \"Terry\" or \"Christine\".\n\n\"Christine is Terry's descendant\" and \"Jordan is Christine's ancestor\", so Jordan is ancestor of Christine, thus of Terry.\n\nBut not Mary or Logan.\n\nI think I should accept that there is no direct relationship, so option 5.\n\nBut let's check the initial list for any direct link.\n\n\"Logan is Arthur's descendant\"\n\n\"Mary is Martha's descendant\"\n\nNo other mentions of Logan or Mary.\n\nSo probably they are not related, so none of the above.\n\nBut the question is to determine the relationship, and the options include \"share a common ancestor\" which might be true if they have a common ancestor not listed, but in the context, with the given information, it might not be.\n\nPerhaps through \"Austin\".\n\n\"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" and \"Austin is Kyle's descendant\", so Kyle is ancestor of Austin.\n\n\"Kyle is Katherine's descendant\" so Katherine is ancestor of Kyle, thus of Austin.\n\n\"Richard\" is \"Austin is Richard's ancestor\" so Richard is descendant of Austin.\n\n\"Raymond is Lawrence's descendant\" and \"Ashley is Lawrence's ancestor\", etc.\n\nNot related.\n\nAnother person: \"Raymond is Lawrence's descendant\" so Lawrence is ancestor of Raymond.\n\n\"Raymond is Nicholas's ancestor\" so Nicholas is ancestor of Raymond, so Raymond is descendant of Nicholas.\n\n\"Nicholas is Judy's ancestor\" so Judy is descendant of Nicholas.\n\n\"Judy is Nicholas's descendant\" same.\n\n\"Judy is Nicholas's descendant\" and \"Nicholas is Judy's ancestor\", consistent.\n\nBut Daniel is Judy's descendant, so Daniel is descendant of Judy, thus of Nicholas.\n\nBut not for Mary or Logan.\n\nI think I have to give up and choose option 5.\n\nBut let's see the answer choices; perhaps I missed something.\n\nMaybe Mary and Logan share a common ancestor through \"Henry\" or something.\n\nHenry is Sharon's ancestor, Sharon is Arthur's ancestor.\n\nHenry is Gregory's descendant, Gregory is Donald's descendant, etc.\n\nFor Mary, no Henry.\n\nBut \"Henry is Gregory's descendant\" and \"Gregory is Donald's descendant\", but Mary has Gregory? No.\n\nUnless \"Gregory\" is in Mary's chain, but in my list, for Mary, I have Bradley, not Gregory.\n\nBradley and Gregory are different.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps \"Shirley\" and \"Shirley is Bradley's ancestor\", but for Logan, no Shirley.\n\nI think it's impossible, so answer is 5.\n\nBut let's confirm with another way.\n\nPerhaps \"Austin\" is related.\n\nAustin is Richard's ancestor, Richard is Lauren is Richard's descendant, but Lauren is not in Mary's chain.\n\nMary's chain has Barbara, Natalie, etc.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: \"Patricia\" or \"Alice\".\n\n\"Alice is Patricia's descendant\" and \"Alice is Elizabeth's ancestor\", but Elizabeth is Nancy's ancestor, etc.\n\nNot related.\n\nI think I should go with 5.\n\nSo the answer is 5.
