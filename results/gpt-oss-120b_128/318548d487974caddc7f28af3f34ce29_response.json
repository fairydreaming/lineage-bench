Actually Kathryn is ancestor of Kenneth, so Kathryn -> Kenneth -> Teresa etc). Also Kathryn is Thomas's descendant, meaning Thomas ancestor of Kathryn.

Meanwhile Bryan is also ancestor of Teresa (through long chain). So they share a common descendant (Teresa) or common ancestor? Let's see.\n\nBryan is ancestor of Teresa (as we traced). Austin is also ancestor of Teresa (via Rachel->Thomas->Kathryn->Kenneth->Teresa). Therefore they share a common descendant (Teresa). So answer: they share a common descendant.\n\nCheck if they share a common ancestor? Could also share earlier ancestor? The chain for Bryan goes back to... Bryan is descendant of? Not given any ancestor for Bryan. So Bryan is at top of that branch. Austin is also descendant of? Not given any ancestor for Austin. So they likely have no common ancestor unless they converge higher up, but we have no info linking Bryan's ancestors to Austin's ancestors. So the relationship is they share a common descendant (Teresa).
