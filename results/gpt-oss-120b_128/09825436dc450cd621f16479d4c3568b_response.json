We need to see if Doris is ancestor/descendant of Edward, share common ancestor, share common descendant, etc.\n\nWe have statements: \"Doris is Jeremy's descendant.\" Also \"Michael is Edward's ancestor.\" So Edward has ancestor Michael. Also \"Michael is Edward's ancestor.\" So Edward is descendant of Michael.\n\nWe need to see any connection between Doris and Edward via other relations.\n\nList all statements involving Doris: only \"Doris is Jeremy's descendant.\" Also \"Doris is Jeremy's descendant.\" That's it.\n\nAny statements about Jeremy? \"Jeremy is Mary's descendant.\" Also \"Jeremy is Mary's descendant.\" So Jeremy descendant of Mary. Also \"Jeremy is Mary's descendant.\" So chain: Mary -> Jeremy -> Doris (descendant chain). So Doris is descendant of Jeremy, who is descendant of Mary. So Doris is descendant of Mary.\n\nAny other statements about Mary? \"Benjamin is Mary's ancestor.\" So Benjamin ancestor of Mary. Also \"Jeremy is Mary's descendant.\" Already. Also \"Margaret is Joe's ancestor.\" Not relevant. \"Jeremy is Mary's descendant.\" So Mary is descendant of Benjamin. So chain: Benjamin -> Mary -> Jeremy -> Doris. So Doris is descendant of Benjamin.\n\nAny other statements linking Edward? Edward's ancestor Michael. Also \"Frances is Michael's ancestor.\" So Frances -> Michael -> Edward. Also \"Aaron is Frances's ancestor.\" So Aaron -> Frances -> Michael -> Edward. Also \"David is Aaron's ancestor.\" So David -> Aaron -> Frances -> Michael -> Edward. Also \"David is Diana's descendant.\" Wait \"David is Diana's descendant.\" So Diana -> David? Actually \"David is Diana's descendant\" means David descendant of Diana.

So chain: Amanda -> Diana -> David -> Aaron -> Frances -> Michael -> Edward.\n\nAlso \"Emma is Alan's ancestor.\" Not relevant.\n\nNow any link between Doris and Edward via common ancestor? We have Doris descendant chain from Benjamin. Edward descendant chain from Michael. Do Benjamin and Michael share any relationship? Look for statements linking them.\n\nSearch statements: \"Benjamin is Mary's ancestor.\" \"Michael is Edward's ancestor.\" No direct link. Any statement about Benjamin being descendant of someone else? Not seen. Any about Michael being descendant of someone else? \"Frances is Michael's ancestor.\" So Michael descendant of Frances. Any link between Benjamin and Frances? Not directly.\n\nCheck other statements: \"Aaron is Frances's ancestor.\" So Frances descendant of Aaron. So Michael descendant of Frances descendant of Aaron. So Michael descendant of Aaron. So Edward descendant of Michael descendant of Aaron. So Edward descendant of Aaron.\n\nNow any link between Aaron and Benjamin? Not seen.\n\nCheck other statements: \"David is Aaron's ancestor.\" So Aaron descendant of David. So chain: David -> Aaron -> Frances -> Michael -> Edward. Also David descendant of Diana? Actually \"David is Diana's descendant.\" So Diana -> David. So chain: Diana -> David -> Aaron -> ... So Edward descendant of Diana as well.\n\nNow any link between Diana and Benjamin? Not seen.\n\nCheck other statements: \"Amanda is Diana's ancestor.\" So Amanda -> Diana -> ... So Edward descendant of Amanda.\n\nNow any link between Amanda and Benjamin? Not seen.\n\nThus no common ancestor known between Doris and Edward from given statements, unless there is hidden link via other individuals.\n\nWe need to see if they share a common descendant: i.e., there exists someone who is descendant of both Doris and Edward. Unlikely given limited connections.\n\nCheck if any statement mentions Doris as ancestor of someone else? No.\n\nCheck if any statement mentions Edward as ancestor of someone else? Not directly, only Michael is Edward's ancestor, not descendant.\n\nThus likely answer is \"None of the above is correct.\"\n\nBut need to be sure there is no indirect connection: maybe both share a common ancestor like \"John\" etc. Let's map Doris ancestors: Doris -> Jeremy -> Mary -> Benjamin (maybe also other ancestors above Benjamin?
