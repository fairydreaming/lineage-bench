- Mason is Maria's ancestor: Lawrence → Joan → Kelly → Mason → Maria

**Tracing Nancy's lineage (working upward):**
- Nancy is Julie's descendant (given)
- Julie is Edward's descendant (given)
- Christopher is Edward's ancestor (given)
- Terry is Christopher's ancestor (given)

So: Terry → Christopher → Edward → Julie → Nancy

**Tracing Roger's lineage (working upward):**
- Frank is Roger's ancestor (given)
- Frank is Catherine's descendant (given)
- Catherine is Terry's descendant (given)

So: Terry → Catherine → Frank → Roger

**Analyzing the relationship:**

Both lineage chains share Terry at the top:
- Terry → Christopher → Edward → Julie → Nancy
- Terry → Catherine → Frank → Roger

This means:
- Terry is an ancestor of Nancy (through the Christopher-Edward-Julie line)
- Terry is an ancestor of Roger (through the Catherine-Frank line)

The two branches (Christopher's line and Catherine's line) diverge from Terry, making Nancy and Roger in separate branches of the family tree that share a common ancestor.

1. ""Share a common descendant"" - No evidence of any person descending from both Roger and Nancy
2. ""Roger is Nancy's descendant"" - No, they're in parallel branches

**Tracing Scott's lineage (going up):**
- Scott is Rachel's descendant → Rachel is an ancestor of Scott
- Rachel is Jesse's descendant → Jesse is an ancestor of Rachel
- Jesse is Kevin's descendant → Kevin is an ancestor of Jesse
- Kevin is Walter's descendant → Walter is an ancestor of Kevin

So: Walter → Kevin → Jesse → Rachel → Scott

**Tracing Doris's lineage (going up):**
- Helen is Doris's ancestor → Helen is above Doris
- Helen is Jacob's descendant → Jacob is an ancestor of Helen
- Walter is Jacob's ancestor → Walter is above Jacob

So: Walter → Jacob → Helen → Doris

**Finding the relationship:**
Both chains trace back to Walter:
- Scott is a descendant of Walter (through Kevin → Jesse → Rachel)
- Doris is a descendant of Walter (through Jacob → Helen)

This means **Walter is a common ancestor** of both Scott and Doris.

Scott is NOT Doris's ancestor (no direct line from Scott to Doris).
Scott is NOT Doris's descendant (no direct line from Doris to Scott).
There's no information about them sharing a common descendant.

Let me convert each statement (where X → Y means ""X is an ancestor of Y""):

1. Benjamin → Kenneth
2. Joshua → Christine (since Christine is Joshua's descendant)
3. Madison → Kenneth (since Kenneth is Madison's descendant)
4. Patrick → Ethan (since Ethan is Patrick's descendant)
5. Christine → Patrick
6. Ethan → Benjamin (since Ethan is Benjamin's ancestor)
7. Terry → Madison (since Madison is Terry's descendant)

Now I'll build the complete chains:

**From Joshua's chain:**
- Joshua → Christine (from statement 2)
- Christine → Patrick (from statement 5)
- Patrick → Ethan (from statement 4)
- Ethan → Benjamin (from statement 6)
- Benjamin → Kenneth (from statement 1)

Complete chain: **Joshua → Christine → Patrick → Ethan → Benjamin → Kenneth**

**From Terry's chain:**
- Terry → Madison (from statement 7)
- Madison → Kenneth (from statement 3)

Complete chain: **Terry → Madison → Kenneth**

**Analysis:**
Both chains lead to Kenneth as a common endpoint:
- Joshua is an ancestor of Kenneth
- Terry is an ancestor of Kenneth

Therefore, Kenneth is a descendant of both Terry and Joshua.

Checking each option:
1. Common ancestor? No information about ancestors of Joshua or Terry.
2. Terry is Joshua's ancestor? No path from Terry to Joshua exists.
3. Common descendant? Yes - Kenneth is descended from both.
4. Terry is Joshua's descendant? No path from Joshua to Terry exists.

From the given relationships:
- Brittany is Sandra's ancestor → Brittany → Sandra
- Sandra is Joan's ancestor → Sandra → Joan
- Joan is Sharon's ancestor → Joan → Sharon
- Sharon is Diana's ancestor → Sharon → Diana
- Christina is Diana's descendant → Diana → Christina

**Analyzing Angela's position:**

From the given information:
- Mason is Angela's descendant → Angela is an ancestor of Mason

So:
- Angela is an ancestor of Mason
- Brittany is also an ancestor of Mason (through the chain established above)

**Determining the relationship:**

Both Angela and Brittany are ancestors of Mason. This means **Mason is a descendant of both Angela and Brittany**.

While I cannot determine from the given information whether Angela is specifically Brittany's ancestor or descendant (as Angela's exact position in relation to the Brittany→Mason chain is not specified), I can definitively conclude that:

- Mason is a common descendant of both Angela and Brittany

This means Angela and Brittany share a common descendant.
