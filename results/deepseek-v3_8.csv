6. **Andrea is Kelly's ancestor.**
   - Andrea is above Kelly in the family tree.

7. **Susan is Janet's ancestor.**
   - Susan is above Janet in the family tree.

Now, let's piece together the relationships:

- From points 2 and 4, Kayla is both Adam's ancestor and Janet's descendant. This means Janet is above Kayla, who is above Adam.
- From point 7, Susan is Janet's ancestor, so Susan is above Janet.
- From point 5, Susan is Kelly's descendant, so Kelly is above Susan.
- From point 6, Andrea is Kelly's ancestor, so Andrea is above Kelly.
