No chain shows that either is an ancestor or descendant of the other, nor is there any identified person who is a descendant of both.\n\nBecause we have two disconnected chains within this overall set of relationships, we cannot conclude that Randy is either an ancestor or descendant of Bobby, or that they have shared a descendant.
