There is no mention that David and Thomas are part of a larger connected family tree (sharing either a common descendant or a common ancestor), nor a direct descendant/ancestor connection between them.\n\nSince we find no relationship tying David’s branch to Thomas’s branch, the correct answer is that none of the above options is correct.\n\n<ANSWER>5</ANSWER>","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":986,"completion_tokens":1175,"total_tokens":2161,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":960}}}
