No, it says: Ralph is Joan's ancestor, and Ralph is Jack's descendant? Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the given: \"Ralph is Joan's ancestor.\" So Ralph -> Joan.\n\nAnd \"Ralph is Jack's descendant.\" So Jack -> Ralph.\n\nSo Jack -> Ralph -> Joan.\n\nAlso, Joan is Sara's ancestor, so Joan -> Sara.\n\nAnd Judith is Sara's descendant, so Sara -> Judith.\n\nJudith is James's ancestor, so Judith -> James.\n\nJames is Jacqueline's ancestor, so James -> Jacqueline.\n\nJacqueline is Paul's ancestor, so Jacqueline -> Paul.\n\nPhilip is Paul's descendant, so Paul -> Philip.\n\nJuan is Philip's descendant, so Philip -> Juan.\n\nJuan is Emma's ancestor, so Juan -> Emma.\n\nEmma is Thomas's ancestor, so Emma -> Thomas.\n\nThomas is Denise's ancestor, so Thomas -> Denise.\n\nKaren is Denise's descendant, so Denise -> Karen.\n\nKaren is Sean's ancestor, so Karen -> Sean.\n\nNicole is Sean's descendant, so Sean -> Nicole.\n\nNicole is Maria's ancestor, so Nicole -> Maria.\n\nMaria is Adam's descendant, so Maria -> Adam.\n\nAdam is Kenneth's descendant?
