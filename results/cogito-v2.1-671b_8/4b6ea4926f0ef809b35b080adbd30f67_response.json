So, Christina → ... → Nicholas → ... → Michelle.\n\nPoint 2: Gregory is Michelle's descendant. Since Nicholas is Michelle's ancestor, Michelle is between Nicholas and Gregory. So, Nicholas → ... → Michelle → ... → Gregory.\n\nPoint 5: Amber is Gregory's descendant. So, Gregory → ... → Amber.\n\nPutting that together: Christina → ... → Nicholas → ... → Michelle → ... → Gregory → ... → Amber.\n\nNow, let's look at the other relationships.\n\nPoint 4: Richard is Anna's ancestor. So, Richard → ... → Anna.\n\nPoint 6: Richard is Mary's descendant. So, Mary → ... → Richard → ... → Anna.\n\nPoint 7: Christina is Anna's descendant. Wait, that's interesting. So, Christina is a descendant of Anna? But earlier, Christina is an ancestor of Nicholas. Let me parse that.\n\nPoint 7 says: Christina is Anna's descendant. So, Anna → ... → Christina.\n\nBut from point 1, Christina is Nicholas's ancestor: Christina → ... → Nicholas.\n\nAnd from point 3, Nicholas is Michelle's ancestor: Nicholas → ... → Michelle.\n\nSo combining: Anna → ... → Christina → ... → Nicholas → ... → Michelle → ... → Gregory → ... → Amber.\n\nAlso, from point 4 and 6: Mary → ... → Richard → ... → Anna.\n\nSo, Mary → ... → Richard → ... → Anna → ... → Christina → ... → Nicholas → ... → Michelle → ... → Gregory → ... → Amber.\n\nNow, the question is about the relationship between Amber and Mary.\n\nFrom the chain above, Mary is an ancestor of Richard, who is an ancestor of Anna, who is an ancestor of Christina, and so on down to Amber. So, Mary is an ancestor of Amber.\n\nTherefore, Amber is Mary's descendant.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n1. Amber is Mary's ancestor. - No, it's the opposite.\n2. Amber and Mary share a common ancestor. - Well, they might, but there's a direct line.\n3. Amber and Mary share a common descendant. - Not necessarily; Amber is a descendant of Mary.\n4. Amber is Mary's descendant. - Yes, that seems correct.\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nSo, option 4 seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any relationships.\n\n- Mary is an ancestor of Richard (point 6: Richard is Mary's descendant).\n- Richard is an ancestor of Anna (point 4: Richard is Anna's ancestor).\n- Anna is an ancestor of Christina (point 7: Christina is Anna's descendant).\n- Christina is an ancestor of Nicholas (point 1: Christina is Nicholas's ancestor).\n- Nicholas is an ancestor of Michelle (point 3: Nicholas is Michelle's ancestor).\n- Michelle is an ancestor of Gregory (point 2: Gregory is Michelle's descendant).\n- Gregory is an ancestor of Amber (point 5: Amber is Gregory's descendant).\n\nSo, the lineage is: Mary → ... → Richard → ... → Anna → ... → Christina → ... → Nicholas → ... → Michelle → ... → Gregory → ... → Amber.\n\nTherefore, Mary is an ancestor of Amber, so Amber is Mary's descendant. That's option 4.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's any possibility of another interpretation.\n\nIs there any chance that the relationships could be mixed? For example, when it says \"Christina is Anna's descendant,\" that means Anna is the ancestor, so the arrow goes from Anna to Christina. Yes, that's how I interpreted it.\n\nSimilarly, \"Richard is Mary's descendant\" means Mary is the ancestor, so Mary to Richard.\n\nEverything seems to chain together properly.
