Hmm, this seems like a lot of relationships to sort through. Let me start by listing out all the given information and see if I can connect Madison to Shirley through some chain of ancestors or descendants.\n\nFirst, let me note down all the relevant entries that mention Madison or Shirley.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- Harold is Madison's descendant. So Madison → Harold (Madison is ancestor of Harold)\n- Evelyn is Shirley's descendant. So Shirley → Evelyn (Shirley is ancestor of Evelyn)\n- Harold is Madison's descendant. Wait, no: \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" means Madison is the ancestor of Harold. So Madison → Harold.\n\nWait, lineage terms can be confusing. If A is B's descendant, then B is A's ancestor. So \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" means Madison is Harold's ancestor. So Madison → Harold (ancestor to descendant).\n\nSimilarly, \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" means Shirley → Evelyn.\n\nNow, looking for connections between Madison and Shirley. Let's see if there's a chain that links them.\n\nLet's list all the relationships step by step.\n\nFirst, Madison's line:\n\n- Harold is Madison's descendant. So Madison → Harold.\n\nNow, Harold's descendants or ancestors? Wait, we need to see if Harold connects to someone else.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- Jordan is Harold's descendant. So Harold → Jordan.\n\nWait, \"Jordan is Harold's descendant\" means Harold is Jordan's ancestor. So Harold → Jordan.\n\nAlso, \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\" So Jordan → Noah.\n\nWait, \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\" → Noah is Jordan's descendant. So Jordan → Noah.\n\nWait, no: If Jordan is Noah's ancestor, then Jordan is the ancestor, Noah is descendant. So Jordan → Noah.\n\nWait, the phrasing: \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\" → Jordan is ancestor of Noah, so Noah is descendant of Jordan.\n\nSimilarly, \"Timothy is Noah's descendant\" → Timothy is descendant of Noah, so Noah → Timothy.\n\nWait, but let's get back to Harold. Harold → Jordan (since Jordan is Harold's descendant), then Jordan → Noah (Jordan is Noah's ancestor), so Harold → Jordan → Noah.\n\nBut how does this connect to Shirley?\n\nShirley's line: Shirley → Evelyn (Evelyn is Shirley's descendant). Also, \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" So Evelyn → Theresa.\n\nWait, \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" → Evelyn → Theresa.\n\nBut Theresa is also mentioned as \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\" So Theresa → Peter.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nWait, let's see if there's another connection. Let's look for other people connected to Madison or Shirley.\n\nWait, another entry: \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" Wait, no, the original says \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" So Madison is Harold's ancestor. So Madison → Harold.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" So yes, Madison is ancestor, Harold is descendant.\n\nNow, looking for connections from Harold. \"Jordan is Harold's descendant.\" So Harold → Jordan.\n\n\"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\" So Jordan → Noah.\n\n\"Timothy is Noah's descendant.\" So Noah → Timothy.\n\n\"Matthew is Timothy's descendant.\" So Timothy → Matthew.\n\n\"Matthew is Mary's ancestor.\" So Matthew → Mary.\n\n\"Mary is Janet's ancestor.\" So Mary → Janet.\n\n\"Katherine is Janet's descendant.\" So Janet → Katherine.\n\n\"Dorothy is Katherine's descendant.\" So Katherine → Dorothy.\n\n\"Brandon is Dorothy's descendant.\" So Dorothy → Brandon.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm getting off track. Let's see if there's a connection between Shirley and someone else.\n\nShirley → Evelyn (Evelyn is Shirley's descendant). Then \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" So Evelyn → Theresa. \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\" So Theresa → Peter. \"Barbara is Peter's descendant.\" So Peter → Barbara.\n\nBut how does this connect to Madison?\n\nWait, let's check if there's a connection between Madison's line and Shirley's line.\n\nMadison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon.\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara.\n\nHmm, not seeing a direct link. Wait, maybe there's another path.\n\nWait, let's check other entries. Let's look for any mention of Shirley or Madison elsewhere.\n\nWait, \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant.\" So Shirley is ancestor of Evelyn.\n\nAlso, \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" So Evelyn is ancestor of Theresa.\n\n\"Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\" So Theresa is ancestor of Peter.\n\n\"Barbara is Peter's descendant.\" So Peter is ancestor of Barbara.\n\nNot sure.\n\nWait, another entry: \"Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\" And \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant.\" So Margaret → Daniel (since Margaret is descendant of Daniel? Wait, no: \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant\" → Daniel → Margaret.\n\nWait, \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant\" → Daniel is ancestor, Margaret is descendant. So Daniel → Margaret.\n\n\"Margaret is Judy's ancestor\" → Margaret → Judy.\n\nSo Daniel → Margaret → Judy.\n\nAlso, \"Judy is Christina's ancestor.\" So Judy → Christina.\n\n\"Christina is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Christina → Bradley.\n\n\"Bradley is Ralph's ancestor.\" So Bradley → Ralph.\n\n\"Jack is Ralph's descendant.\" So Ralph → Jack.\n\n\"Jack is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Jack → Eugene.\n\n\"Eugene is Samantha's ancestor.\" So Eugene → Samantha.\n\n\"George is Samantha's descendant.\" So Samantha → George.\n\nWait, but how does this connect to Madison or Shirley?\n\nWait, let's check if any of these chains connect to Madison or Shirley.\n\nWait, Madison's line: Madison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon.\n\nWait, \"Brandon is Anthony's ancestor.\" So Brandon → Anthony.\n\n\" Mason is Anthony's descendant.\" So Anthony → Mason.\n\n\"James is Mason's descendant.\" So Mason → James.\n\n\"James is Karen's ancestor.\" So James → Karen.\n\n\"Brian is Karen's descendant.\" So Karen → Brian.\n\n\"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\" So Brian → Lawrence.\n\n\"Lawrence is Marie's ancestor.\" So Lawrence → Marie.\n\n\"Marie is Joan's ancestor.\" So Marie → Joan.\n\n\"Joyce is Joan's descendant.\" So Joan → Joyce.\n\n\"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\" So Joyce → Melissa.\n\n\"Michelle is Betty's ancestor.\" So Michelle → Betty.\n\n\"Beth is Hannah's ancestor.\" Wait, \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\" Wait, the entry says \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\" So Betty → Hannah.\n\nWait, \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor\" → Betty is ancestor, Hannah is descendant.\n\nAlso, \"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor.\" So Hannah → Daniel.\n\nWait, \"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor\" → Hannah → Daniel.\n\nSo Hannah → Daniel.\n\nEarlier, we had Daniel → Margaret (since Margaret is Daniel's descendant), so Daniel → Margaret.\n\nWait, but Hannah is Daniel's ancestor, so Hannah → Daniel → Margaret.\n\nSo Hannah → Daniel → Margaret.\n\nBut Betty is Hannah's ancestor, so Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret.\n\nWait, let's parse that.\n\n\"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\" So Betty → Hannah.\n\n\"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor.\" So Hannah → Daniel.\n\n\"Margaret is Daniel's descendant.\" So Daniel → Margaret.\n\nTherefore, Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret.\n\nAlso, \"Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\" So Margaret → Judy.\n\nSo Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy.\n\nThen Judy → Christina (Judy is Christina's ancestor), Christina → Bradley, Bradley → Ralph, Ralph → Jack, Jack → Eugene, Eugene → Samantha, Samantha → George.\n\nBut how does this connect to Madison or Shirley?\n\nWait, let's see if there's a connection between Madison's line and this Betty-Hannah-Daniel line.\n\nMadison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → Anthony → Mason → James → Karen → Brian → Lawrence → Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nWait, \"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\" So Joyce → Melissa.\n\n\"Michelle is Betty's ancestor.\" So Michelle → Betty.\n\nWait, Michelle → Betty.\n\nBut \"Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\" So Alice → Michelle.\n\nAlso, \"Alice is Douglas's descendant.\" Wait, \"Alice is Douglas's descendant\" → Douglas → Alice.\n\nWait, \"Alice is Michelle's ancestor\" → Alice → Michelle.\n\nSo Alice → Michelle → Betty.\n\nAnd \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor\" → Betty → Hannah.\n\nSo putting that together: Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nNow, Madison's line: Madison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → Anthony → Mason → James → Karen → Brian → Lawrence → Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nWait, Joyce → Melissa (from Joyce is Melissa's ancestor).\n\nSo Madison's line leads to Melissa.\n\nBut Alice's line leads to Michelle → Betty → Hannah → ... → Melissa.\n\nWait, Melissa is in both lines?\n\nWait, Madison's line ends at Melissa? Let's check:\n\nMadison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → Anthony → Mason → James → Karen → Brian → Lawrence → Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nSo yes, Madison's line goes through Joyce to Melissa.\n\nAnd Alice's line: Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nWait, George is Samantha's descendant, so George is in that line.\n\nBut how does Shirley fit in?\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara.\n\nWait, \"Barbara is Peter's descendant\" → Peter → Barbara.\n\n\"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" → Theresa → Peter.\n\n\"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" → Shirley → Evelyn.\n\nSo Shirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara.\n\nIs there any connection between Barbara or Peter and the Madison line?\n\nLooking at the list, \"Barbara is Nicole's ancestor.\" So Barbara → Nicole.\n\n\"Patricia is Carol's descendant.\" So Carol → Patricia.\n\n\"Charlotte is Carol's ancestor.\" So Charlotte → Carol.\n\n\"Patricia is Carol's descendant\" → Carol → Patricia.\n\n\"Barbara is Nicole's ancestor\" → Barbara → Nicole.\n\n\"Elijah is Nicole's descendant.\" So Nicole → Elijah.\n\n\"Elijah is Kevin's ancestor.\" So Elijah → Kevin.\n\n\"Kevin\" is mentioned here. Also, \"Sophia is Kevin's descendant.\" So Kevin → Sophia.\n\n\"Brian is Sophia's descendant.\" Wait, no: \"Scott is Sophia's descendant.\" Wait, \"Scott is Sophia's descendant.\" So Sophia → Scott.\n\nWait, \"Brian is Karen's descendant.\" Wait, Brian is Karen's descendant → Karen → Brian.\n\nWait, Karen is in Madison's line: Madison → ... → Karen.\n\nSo Karen → Brian.\n\nAlso, \"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\" So Brian → Lawrence.\n\nLawrence → Marie (Lawrence is Marie's ancestor).\n\nMarie → Joan.\n\nJoan → Joyce.\n\nJoyce → Melissa.\n\nSo Madison's line goes through Karen to Brian to Lawrence to Marie to Joan to Joyce to Melissa.\n\nNow, back to Shirley's line: Shirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara → Nicole → Elijah → Kevin → Sophia.\n\nWait, Sophia is Kevin's descendant, so Kevin → Sophia.\n\nAnd \"Brian is Sophia's descendant.\" Wait, no: \"Brian is Karen's descendant\" → Karen → Brian.\n\nWait, the entry says \"Brian is Sophia's descendant.\" Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back at the list: \"Brian is Karen's descendant.\" Yes. And \"Scott is Sophia's descendant.\" So Sophia → Scott.\n\nWait, \"Brian is Sophia's descendant.\" Wait, no. Let's check:\n\nOriginal list:\n\n* Brian is Karen's descendant.\n\n* Scott is Sophia's descendant.\n\n* Sophia is Kevin's descendant.\n\nWait, \"Sophia is Kevin's descendant\" → Kevin → Sophia.\n\nSo Kevin → Sophia.\n\nThen \"Scott is Sophia's descendant\" → Sophia → Scott.\n\nSo Kevin → Sophia → Scott.\n\nAnd \"Donald is Scott's descendant\" → Scott → Donald.\n\n\"Rachel is Donald's descendant\" → Donald → Rachel.\n\n\"Austin is Rachel's descendant\" → Rachel → Austin.\n\n\"Douglas is Austin's descendant\" → Austin → Douglas.\n\n\"Alice is Douglas's descendant\" → Douglas → Alice.\n\nAh, here's a connection. Let's follow this chain:\n\nDouglas → Alice (from \"Alice is Douglas's descendant\" → Douglas is ancestor, Alice is descendant).\n\nAlice → Michelle (Alice is Michelle's ancestor).\n\nMichelle → Betty (Michelle is Betty's ancestor).\n\nBetty → Hannah (Betty is Hannah's ancestor).\n\nHannah → Daniel (Hannah is Daniel's ancestor).\n\nDaniel → Margaret (Margaret is Daniel's descendant).\n\nMargaret → Judy (Margaret is Judy's ancestor).\n\nJudy → Christina (Judy is Christina's ancestor).\n\nChristina → Bradley (Christina is Bradley's ancestor).\n\nBradley → Ralph (Bradley is Ralph's ancestor).\n\nRalph → Jack (Jack is Ralph's descendant).\n\nJack → Eugene (Jack is Eugene's ancestor).\n\nEugene → Samantha (Eugene is Samantha's ancestor).\n\nSamantha → George (George is Samantha's descendant).\n\nBut also, from the other side:\n\nKevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice.\n\nSo this chain connects back to Alice.\n\nWait, so there's a loop here? Let's see:\n\nFrom Kevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice.\n\nAnd Alice is connected to Michelle, etc.\n\nBut how does this relate to Madison and Shirley?\n\nWait, let's recap the Madison line:\n\nMadison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → Anthony → Mason → James → Karen → Brian → Lawrence → Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nAnd the Shirley line:\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara → Nicole → Elijah → Kevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nWait a second, the Shirley line connects all the way to George, and the Madison line connects to Melissa.\n\nBut do these two lines intersect anywhere?\n\nWait, the Madison line ends at Melissa, and the Shirley line ends at George. But is there a common point?\n\nWait, let's check if Melissa is connected to anyone in the Shirley line.\n\nFrom the Madison line: Joyce → Melissa.\n\nIn the Shirley line, is there a connection to Joyce?\n\nWait, in the Shirley line, we have Joyce coming from Marie → Joan → Joyce.\n\nWait, Marie is in Madison's line: Madison → ... → Lawrence → Marie.\n\nSo Marie is part of Madison's line.\n\nAnd Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nSo Melissa is in Madison's line.\n\nIn the Shirley line, do we have Joyce? Let's see:\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara → Nicole → Elijah → Kevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nNo mention of Joyce here. Wait, but Joyce is in Madison's line. So the Shirley line doesn't go through Joyce.\n\nWait, but wait: \"Joyce is Joan's descendant.\" So Joan → Joyce.\n\nAnd \"Marie is Joan's ancestor.\" So Marie → Joan.\n\nSo Marie → Joan → Joyce.\n\nMarie is in Madison's line (Madison → ... → Lawrence → Marie).\n\nSo Madison's line includes Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nShirley's line doesn't include Marie or Joyce. So unless there's another connection.\n\nWait, let's check if there's any other mention of Shirley or Madison.\n\nWait, another entry: \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" So Madison → Harold.\n\n\"Jordan is Harold's descendant.\" Harold → Jordan.\n\n\"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\" Jordan → Noah.\n\n\"Timothy is Noah's descendant.\" Noah → Timothy.\n\n\"Matthew is Timothy's descendant.\" Timothy → Matthew.\n\n\"Matthew is Mary's ancestor.\" Matthew → Mary.\n\n\"Mary is Janet's ancestor.\" Mary → Janet.\n\n\"Katherine is Janet's descendant.\" Janet → Katherine.\n\n\"Dorothy is Katherine's descendant.\" Katherine → Dorothy.\n\n\"Brandon is Dorothy's descendant.\" Dorothy → Brandon.\n\n\"Brandon is Anthony's ancestor.\" Brandon → Anthony.\n\n\"Mason is Anthony's descendant.\" Anthony → Mason.\n\n\"James is Mason's descendant.\" Mason → James.\n\n\"James is Karen's ancestor.\" James → Karen.\n\n\"Brian is Karen's descendant.\" Karen → Brian.\n\n\"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\" Brian → Lawrence.\n\n\"Lawrence is Marie's ancestor.\" Lawrence → Marie.\n\n\"Marie is Joan's ancestor.\" Marie → Joan.\n\n\"Joyce is Joan's descendant.\" Joan → Joyce.\n\n\"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\" Joyce → Melissa.\n\nSo Madison's line ends at Melissa.\n\nShirley's line:\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara → Nicole → Elijah → Kevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nNow, is there any overlap between these two lines?\n\nMadison's line: Madison, Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa.\n\nShirley's line: Shirley, Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George.\n\nLooking for common names. Let's see:\n\n- Michelle appears in both lines? Madison's line has Joyce → Melissa, but Michelle is in the Shirley line (Alice → Michelle).\n\nWait, Michelle is in Shirley's line as Alice's descendant (Alice → Michelle), but Madison's line goes through Joyce to Melissa. So Michelle is not in Madison's line.\n\nWait, but \"Michelle is Betty's ancestor\" (from \"Michelle is Betty's ancestor\"), so Michelle → Betty.\n\nAnd \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor\", so Betty → Hannah.\n\nSo Michelle is an ancestor in the Shirley line.\n\nBut Madison's line doesn't include Michelle. So the two lines don't overlap in names.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's a connection between the two lines through another person.\n\nWait, \"Alice is Douglas's descendant.\" So Douglas → Alice.\n\nAnd \"Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\" So Alice → Michelle.\n\nBut in the Madison line, we have Douglas coming from the Shirley line: Shirley → ... → Douglas.\n\nWait, Shirley's line goes to Douglas, then Alice, then Michelle.\n\nMadison's line doesn't go through Douglas. So the Shirley line connects to Alice, who is in the Shirley line's chain, but Madison's line doesn't connect to Alice.\n\nWait, but \"Alice is Douglas's descendant\" → Douglas → Alice.\n\nAnd \"Douglas is Austin's descendant\" → Austin → Douglas.\n\n\"Austin is Rachel's descendant\" → Rachel → Austin.\n\n\"Rachel is Donald's descendant\" → Donald → Rachel.\n\n\"Donald is Scott's descendant\" → Scott → Donald.\n\n\"Scott is Sophia's descendant\" → Sophia → Scott.\n\n\"Sophia is Kevin's descendant\" → Kevin → Sophia.\n\n\"Kevin\" is in Shirley's line.\n\nSo Shirley's line leads to Kevin, then Sophia, etc., all the way to Douglas, Alice, Michelle, etc.\n\nMadison's line leads to Melissa.\n\nIs there a connection between Melissa and anyone in Shirley's line?\n\nIn Madison's line, Joyce → Melissa.\n\nIn Shirley's line, we have Joyce? No, Joyce is only in Madison's line.\n\nWait, unless \"Joyce is Joan's descendant\" and Joan is in Madison's line, but Shirley's line doesn't reach Joan.\n\nSo, unless there's another path.\n\nWait, let's check if \"Joyce\" appears elsewhere. The only mention is \"Joyce is Joan's descendant\" and \"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\"\n\nSo Joyce is only in Madison's line.\n\nNow, the question is about Madison and Shirley. Do they have a relationship?\n\nWe need to see if Madison is an ancestor of Shirley, descendant, share common ancestor, common descendant, or none.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Is Madison an ancestor of Shirley? For that, Shirley would have to be in Madison's descendant line.\n\nMadison's descendants: Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa.\n\nShirley is not in that list.\n\n- Is Shirley an ancestor of Madison? Then Madison would be in Shirley's descendant line.\n\nShirley's descendants: Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George.\n\nMadison is not in that list.\n\nSo they don't have a direct ancestor-descendant relationship.\n\nDo they share a common ancestor?\n\nA common ancestor would be someone who is an ancestor of both Madison and Shirley.\n\nTo find that, we need to see if there's a person X such that X is an ancestor of Madison and X is an ancestor of Shirley.\n\nSimilarly, common descendant would be someone who is a descendant of both.\n\nLet's try to find a common ancestor.\n\nFirst, let's trace back from Madison.\n\nMadison's ancestors: Not directly given, but we can see if there's someone who is an ancestor of Madison.\n\nWait, the given relationships are all from the list. We have to assume that the given relationships are the only ones we can use.\n\nWait, the problem states \"Given the following lineage relationships,\" so we can only use those to infer.\n\nSo to find a common ancestor, we need to see if there's a person who is an ancestor of both Madison and Shirley.\n\nBut we don't have direct info on Madison's ancestors. The only info is that Harold is Madison's descendant, so Madison's descendant is Harold. To find Madison's ancestors, we'd need someone who is an ancestor of Madison, but none of the given relationships state that.\n\nWait, actually, all the relationships given are either ancestor-descendant pairs. So to find Madison's ancestors, we'd need someone who has Madison as a descendant, but the list doesn't say that. The only thing we know about Madison is that Harold is her descendant.\n\nSimilarly, Shirley's ancestors: We know Evelyn is Shirley's descendant, so Shirley's descendants include Evelyn, but Shirley's ancestors aren't directly stated.\n\nWait, but to find a common ancestor, we need someone who is an ancestor of both Madison and Shirley.\n\nBut without knowing Madison's ancestors or Shirley's ancestors, how can we tell?\n\nWait, but maybe through the chains.\n\nWait, let's consider the Shirley line. The Shirley line goes back to... well, Shirley is the starting point. The Shirley line as we traced goes to George, but Shirley herself is the ancestor of Evelyn.\n\nSimilarly, Madison's line starts with Madison as the ancestor of Harold.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a person who is an ancestor of both.\n\nWait, let's see if the two lines ever meet.\n\nMadison's descendants: Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa.\n\nShirley's descendants: Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George.\n\nNo overlap in descendants. So no common descendant.\n\nFor common ancestor: Is there a person who is an ancestor of both Madison and Shirley?\n\nTo find that, we'd need to see if there's a person X such that X is an ancestor of Madison and X is an ancestor of Shirley.\n\nBut we don't have direct info on Madison's ancestors. The only way is if through some chain.\n\nWait, but Madison's ancestors would have to be someone who is an ancestor of Madison, but the given relationships don't state that. For example, if someone is listed as an ancestor of Madison, but I don't see any such statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the list:\n\n- Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\n\n- Eugene is Samantha's ancestor.\n\n- Doris is Aaron's descendant.\n\nEtc.\n\nNo one is stated as an ancestor of Madison. Similarly, Shirley's ancestors aren't stated.\n\nSo unless through a chain.\n\nWait, but if we consider that all these relationships form a graph, we might have to see if there's a path from Madison to Shirley or vice versa, but since we need a common ancestor, we need a node that connects to both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe through another person.\n\nWait, let's consider the person \"Alice\" who is in Shirley's line.\n\nAlice is in Shirley's line (as part of the chain from Shirley to Alice), and Alice is also an ancestor of Michelle, etc.\n\nBut Madison's line doesn't include Alice.\n\nWait, but let's see if Alice is a descendant of Madison or something. Not that we know.\n\nWait, another angle: Let's look for any mention of \"Madison\" or \"Shirley\" in other relationships.\n\n\"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" So Madison → Harold.\n\n\"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" Wait, no: \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" → Madison is ancestor.\n\n\"Shirley is the ancestor of Evelyn.\"\n\nNo other mentions.\n\nWait, another entry: \"Charlotte is Carol's ancestor.\" Not related.\n\n\"Patricia is Carol's descendant.\" Not related.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe we can find a chain from Madison to Shirley or vice versa.\n\nMadison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → Anthony → Mason → James → Karen → Brian → Lawrence → Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara → Nicole → Elijah → Kevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nIs there any overlap between these two chains?\n\nLooking at the names:\n\nMadison's chain: Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa.\n\nShirley's chain: Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George.\n\nNo common names. So the two chains don't intersect.\n\nTherefore, Madison and Shirley don't have a direct ancestor-descendant relationship, and they don't share a common ancestor or descendant based on the given information.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check if \"Margaret\" is in both lines.\n\nMadison's line: Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → ... Margaret is in Shirley's line.\n\nWait, \"Margaret is Judy's ancestor\" and \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant.\"\n\nIn Madison's line, Margaret is not present.

Hmm, this seems like a lot of relationships to sort through. Let me start by listing out all the given information and see if I can connect Madison to Shirley through some chain of ancestors or descendants.\n\nFirst, let me note down all the relevant entries that mention Madison or Shirley.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- Harold is Madison's descendant. So Madison → Harold (Madison is ancestor of Harold)\n- Evelyn is Shirley's descendant. So Shirley → Evelyn (Shirley is ancestor of Evelyn)\n- Harold is Madison's descendant. Wait, no: \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" means Madison is the ancestor of Harold. So Madison → Harold.\n\nWait, lineage terms can be confusing. If A is B's descendant, then B is A's ancestor. So \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" means Madison is Harold's ancestor. So Madison → Harold (ancestor to descendant).\n\nSimilarly, \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" means Shirley → Evelyn.\n\nNow, looking for connections between Madison and Shirley. Let's see if there's a chain that links them.\n\nLet's list all the relationships step by step.\n\nFirst, Madison's line:\n\n- Harold is Madison's descendant. So Madison → Harold.\n\nNow, Harold's descendants or ancestors? Wait, we need to see if Harold connects to someone else.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- Jordan is Harold's descendant. So Harold → Jordan.\n\nWait, \"Jordan is Harold's descendant\" means Harold is Jordan's ancestor. So Harold → Jordan.\n\nAlso, \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\" So Jordan → Noah.\n\nWait, \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\" → Noah is Jordan's descendant. So Jordan → Noah.\n\nWait, no: If Jordan is Noah's ancestor, then Jordan is the ancestor, Noah is descendant. So Jordan → Noah.\n\nWait, the phrasing: \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\" → Jordan is ancestor of Noah, so Noah is descendant of Jordan.\n\nSimilarly, \"Timothy is Noah's descendant\" → Timothy is descendant of Noah, so Noah → Timothy.\n\nWait, but let's get back to Harold. Harold → Jordan (since Jordan is Harold's descendant), then Jordan → Noah (Jordan is Noah's ancestor), so Harold → Jordan → Noah.\n\nBut how does this connect to Shirley?\n\nShirley's line: Shirley → Evelyn (Evelyn is Shirley's descendant). Also, \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" So Evelyn → Theresa.\n\nWait, \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" → Evelyn → Theresa.\n\nBut Theresa is also mentioned as \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\" So Theresa → Peter.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nWait, let's see if there's another connection. Let's look for other people connected to Madison or Shirley.\n\nWait, another entry: \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" Wait, no, the original says \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" So Madison is Harold's ancestor. So Madison → Harold.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" So yes, Madison is ancestor, Harold is descendant.\n\nNow, looking for connections from Harold. \"Jordan is Harold's descendant.\" So Harold → Jordan.\n\n\"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\" So Jordan → Noah.\n\n\"Timothy is Noah's descendant.\" So Noah → Timothy.\n\n\"Matthew is Timothy's descendant.\" So Timothy → Matthew.\n\n\"Matthew is Mary's ancestor.\" So Matthew → Mary.\n\n\"Mary is Janet's ancestor.\" So Mary → Janet.\n\n\"Katherine is Janet's descendant.\" So Janet → Katherine.\n\n\"Dorothy is Katherine's descendant.\" So Katherine → Dorothy.\n\n\"Brandon is Dorothy's descendant.\" So Dorothy → Brandon.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm getting off track. Let's see if there's a connection between Shirley and someone else.\n\nShirley → Evelyn (Evelyn is Shirley's descendant). Then \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" So Evelyn → Theresa. \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\" So Theresa → Peter. \"Barbara is Peter's descendant.\" So Peter → Barbara.\n\nBut how does this connect to Madison?\n\nWait, let's check if there's a connection between Madison's line and Shirley's line.\n\nMadison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon.\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara.\n\nHmm, not seeing a direct link. Wait, maybe there's another path.\n\nWait, let's check other entries. Let's look for any mention of Shirley or Madison elsewhere.\n\nWait, \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant.\" So Shirley is ancestor of Evelyn.\n\nAlso, \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" So Evelyn is ancestor of Theresa.\n\n\"Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\" So Theresa is ancestor of Peter.\n\n\"Barbara is Peter's descendant.\" So Peter is ancestor of Barbara.\n\nNot sure.\n\nWait, another entry: \"Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\" And \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant.\" So Margaret → Daniel (since Margaret is descendant of Daniel? Wait, no: \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant\" → Daniel → Margaret.\n\nWait, \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant\" → Daniel is ancestor, Margaret is descendant. So Daniel → Margaret.\n\n\"Margaret is Judy's ancestor\" → Margaret → Judy.\n\nSo Daniel → Margaret → Judy.\n\nAlso, \"Judy is Christina's ancestor.\" So Judy → Christina.\n\n\"Christina is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Christina → Bradley.\n\n\"Bradley is Ralph's ancestor.\" So Bradley → Ralph.\n\n\"Jack is Ralph's descendant.\" So Ralph → Jack.\n\n\"Jack is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Jack → Eugene.\n\n\"Eugene is Samantha's ancestor.\" So Eugene → Samantha.\n\n\"George is Samantha's descendant.\" So Samantha → George.\n\nWait, but how does this connect to Madison or Shirley?\n\nWait, let's check if any of these chains connect to Madison or Shirley.\n\nWait, Madison's line: Madison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon.\n\nWait, \"Brandon is Anthony's ancestor.\" So Brandon → Anthony.\n\n\" Mason is Anthony's descendant.\" So Anthony → Mason.\n\n\"James is Mason's descendant.\" So Mason → James.\n\n\"James is Karen's ancestor.\" So James → Karen.\n\n\"Brian is Karen's descendant.\" So Karen → Brian.\n\n\"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\" So Brian → Lawrence.\n\n\"Lawrence is Marie's ancestor.\" So Lawrence → Marie.\n\n\"Marie is Joan's ancestor.\" So Marie → Joan.\n\n\"Joyce is Joan's descendant.\" So Joan → Joyce.\n\n\"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\" So Joyce → Melissa.\n\n\"Michelle is Betty's ancestor.\" So Michelle → Betty.\n\n\"Beth is Hannah's ancestor.\" Wait, \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\" Wait, the entry says \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\" So Betty → Hannah.\n\nWait, \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor\" → Betty is ancestor, Hannah is descendant.\n\nAlso, \"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor.\" So Hannah → Daniel.\n\nWait, \"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor\" → Hannah → Daniel.\n\nSo Hannah → Daniel.\n\nEarlier, we had Daniel → Margaret (since Margaret is Daniel's descendant), so Daniel → Margaret.\n\nWait, but Hannah is Daniel's ancestor, so Hannah → Daniel → Margaret.\n\nSo Hannah → Daniel → Margaret.\n\nBut Betty is Hannah's ancestor, so Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret.\n\nWait, let's parse that.\n\n\"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\" So Betty → Hannah.\n\n\"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor.\" So Hannah → Daniel.\n\n\"Margaret is Daniel's descendant.\" So Daniel → Margaret.\n\nTherefore, Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret.\n\nAlso, \"Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\" So Margaret → Judy.\n\nSo Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy.\n\nThen Judy → Christina (Judy is Christina's ancestor), Christina → Bradley, Bradley → Ralph, Ralph → Jack, Jack → Eugene, Eugene → Samantha, Samantha → George.\n\nBut how does this connect to Madison or Shirley?\n\nWait, let's see if there's a connection between Madison's line and this Betty-Hannah-Daniel line.\n\nMadison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → Anthony → Mason → James → Karen → Brian → Lawrence → Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nWait, \"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\" So Joyce → Melissa.\n\n\"Michelle is Betty's ancestor.\" So Michelle → Betty.\n\nWait, Michelle → Betty.\n\nBut \"Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\" So Alice → Michelle.\n\nAlso, \"Alice is Douglas's descendant.\" Wait, \"Alice is Douglas's descendant\" → Douglas → Alice.\n\nWait, \"Alice is Michelle's ancestor\" → Alice → Michelle.\n\nSo Alice → Michelle → Betty.\n\nAnd \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor\" → Betty → Hannah.\n\nSo putting that together: Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nNow, Madison's line: Madison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → Anthony → Mason → James → Karen → Brian → Lawrence → Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nWait, Joyce → Melissa (from Joyce is Melissa's ancestor).\n\nSo Madison's line leads to Melissa.\n\nBut Alice's line leads to Michelle → Betty → Hannah → ... → Melissa.\n\nWait, Melissa is in both lines?\n\nWait, Madison's line ends at Melissa? Let's check:\n\nMadison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → Anthony → Mason → James → Karen → Brian → Lawrence → Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nSo yes, Madison's line goes through Joyce to Melissa.\n\nAnd Alice's line: Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nWait, George is Samantha's descendant, so George is in that line.\n\nBut how does Shirley fit in?\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara.\n\nWait, \"Barbara is Peter's descendant\" → Peter → Barbara.\n\n\"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" → Theresa → Peter.\n\n\"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" → Shirley → Evelyn.\n\nSo Shirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara.\n\nIs there any connection between Barbara or Peter and the Madison line?\n\nLooking at the list, \"Barbara is Nicole's ancestor.\" So Barbara → Nicole.\n\n\"Patricia is Carol's descendant.\" So Carol → Patricia.\n\n\"Charlotte is Carol's ancestor.\" So Charlotte → Carol.\n\n\"Patricia is Carol's descendant\" → Carol → Patricia.\n\n\"Barbara is Nicole's ancestor\" → Barbara → Nicole.\n\n\"Elijah is Nicole's descendant.\" So Nicole → Elijah.\n\n\"Elijah is Kevin's ancestor.\" So Elijah → Kevin.\n\n\"Kevin\" is mentioned here. Also, \"Sophia is Kevin's descendant.\" So Kevin → Sophia.\n\n\"Brian is Sophia's descendant.\" Wait, no: \"Scott is Sophia's descendant.\" Wait, \"Scott is Sophia's descendant.\" So Sophia → Scott.\n\nWait, \"Brian is Karen's descendant.\" Wait, Brian is Karen's descendant → Karen → Brian.\n\nWait, Karen is in Madison's line: Madison → ... → Karen.\n\nSo Karen → Brian.\n\nAlso, \"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\" So Brian → Lawrence.\n\nLawrence → Marie (Lawrence is Marie's ancestor).\n\nMarie → Joan.\n\nJoan → Joyce.\n\nJoyce → Melissa.\n\nSo Madison's line goes through Karen to Brian to Lawrence to Marie to Joan to Joyce to Melissa.\n\nNow, back to Shirley's line: Shirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara → Nicole → Elijah → Kevin → Sophia.\n\nWait, Sophia is Kevin's descendant, so Kevin → Sophia.\n\nAnd \"Brian is Sophia's descendant.\" Wait, no: \"Brian is Karen's descendant\" → Karen → Brian.\n\nWait, the entry says \"Brian is Sophia's descendant.\" Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back at the list: \"Brian is Karen's descendant.\" Yes. And \"Scott is Sophia's descendant.\" So Sophia → Scott.\n\nWait, \"Brian is Sophia's descendant.\" Wait, no. Let's check:\n\nOriginal list:\n\n* Brian is Karen's descendant.\n\n* Scott is Sophia's descendant.\n\n* Sophia is Kevin's descendant.\n\nWait, \"Sophia is Kevin's descendant\" → Kevin → Sophia.\n\nSo Kevin → Sophia.\n\nThen \"Scott is Sophia's descendant\" → Sophia → Scott.\n\nSo Kevin → Sophia → Scott.\n\nAnd \"Donald is Scott's descendant\" → Scott → Donald.\n\n\"Rachel is Donald's descendant\" → Donald → Rachel.\n\n\"Austin is Rachel's descendant\" → Rachel → Austin.\n\n\"Douglas is Austin's descendant\" → Austin → Douglas.\n\n\"Alice is Douglas's descendant\" → Douglas → Alice.\n\nAh, here's a connection. Let's follow this chain:\n\nDouglas → Alice (from \"Alice is Douglas's descendant\" → Douglas is ancestor, Alice is descendant).\n\nAlice → Michelle (Alice is Michelle's ancestor).\n\nMichelle → Betty (Michelle is Betty's ancestor).\n\nBetty → Hannah (Betty is Hannah's ancestor).\n\nHannah → Daniel (Hannah is Daniel's ancestor).\n\nDaniel → Margaret (Margaret is Daniel's descendant).\n\nMargaret → Judy (Margaret is Judy's ancestor).\n\nJudy → Christina (Judy is Christina's ancestor).\n\nChristina → Bradley (Christina is Bradley's ancestor).\n\nBradley → Ralph (Bradley is Ralph's ancestor).\n\nRalph → Jack (Jack is Ralph's descendant).\n\nJack → Eugene (Jack is Eugene's ancestor).\n\nEugene → Samantha (Eugene is Samantha's ancestor).\n\nSamantha → George (George is Samantha's descendant).\n\nBut also, from the other side:\n\nKevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice.\n\nSo this chain connects back to Alice.\n\nWait, so there's a loop here? Let's see:\n\nFrom Kevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice.\n\nAnd Alice is connected to Michelle, etc.\n\nBut how does this relate to Madison and Shirley?\n\nWait, let's recap the Madison line:\n\nMadison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → Anthony → Mason → James → Karen → Brian → Lawrence → Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nAnd the Shirley line:\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara → Nicole → Elijah → Kevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nWait a second, the Shirley line connects all the way to George, and the Madison line connects to Melissa.\n\nBut do these two lines intersect anywhere?\n\nWait, the Madison line ends at Melissa, and the Shirley line ends at George. But is there a common point?\n\nWait, let's check if Melissa is connected to anyone in the Shirley line.\n\nFrom the Madison line: Joyce → Melissa.\n\nIn the Shirley line, is there a connection to Joyce?\n\nWait, in the Shirley line, we have Joyce coming from Marie → Joan → Joyce.\n\nWait, Marie is in Madison's line: Madison → ... → Lawrence → Marie.\n\nSo Marie is part of Madison's line.\n\nAnd Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nSo Melissa is in Madison's line.\n\nIn the Shirley line, do we have Joyce? Let's see:\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara → Nicole → Elijah → Kevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nNo mention of Joyce here. Wait, but Joyce is in Madison's line. So the Shirley line doesn't go through Joyce.\n\nWait, but wait: \"Joyce is Joan's descendant.\" So Joan → Joyce.\n\nAnd \"Marie is Joan's ancestor.\" So Marie → Joan.\n\nSo Marie → Joan → Joyce.\n\nMarie is in Madison's line (Madison → ... → Lawrence → Marie).\n\nSo Madison's line includes Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nShirley's line doesn't include Marie or Joyce. So unless there's another connection.\n\nWait, let's check if there's any other mention of Shirley or Madison.\n\nWait, another entry: \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" So Madison → Harold.\n\n\"Jordan is Harold's descendant.\" Harold → Jordan.\n\n\"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\" Jordan → Noah.\n\n\"Timothy is Noah's descendant.\" Noah → Timothy.\n\n\"Matthew is Timothy's descendant.\" Timothy → Matthew.\n\n\"Matthew is Mary's ancestor.\" Matthew → Mary.\n\n\"Mary is Janet's ancestor.\" Mary → Janet.\n\n\"Katherine is Janet's descendant.\" Janet → Katherine.\n\n\"Dorothy is Katherine's descendant.\" Katherine → Dorothy.\n\n\"Brandon is Dorothy's descendant.\" Dorothy → Brandon.\n\n\"Brandon is Anthony's ancestor.\" Brandon → Anthony.\n\n\"Mason is Anthony's descendant.\" Anthony → Mason.\n\n\"James is Mason's descendant.\" Mason → James.\n\n\"James is Karen's ancestor.\" James → Karen.\n\n\"Brian is Karen's descendant.\" Karen → Brian.\n\n\"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\" Brian → Lawrence.\n\n\"Lawrence is Marie's ancestor.\" Lawrence → Marie.\n\n\"Marie is Joan's ancestor.\" Marie → Joan.\n\n\"Joyce is Joan's descendant.\" Joan → Joyce.\n\n\"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\" Joyce → Melissa.\n\nSo Madison's line ends at Melissa.\n\nShirley's line:\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara → Nicole → Elijah → Kevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nNow, is there any overlap between these two lines?\n\nMadison's line: Madison, Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa.\n\nShirley's line: Shirley, Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George.\n\nLooking for common names. Let's see:\n\n- Michelle appears in both lines? Madison's line has Joyce → Melissa, but Michelle is in the Shirley line (Alice → Michelle).\n\nWait, Michelle is in Shirley's line as Alice's descendant (Alice → Michelle), but Madison's line goes through Joyce to Melissa. So Michelle is not in Madison's line.\n\nWait, but \"Michelle is Betty's ancestor\" (from \"Michelle is Betty's ancestor\"), so Michelle → Betty.\n\nAnd \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor\", so Betty → Hannah.\n\nSo Michelle is an ancestor in the Shirley line.\n\nBut Madison's line doesn't include Michelle. So the two lines don't overlap in names.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's a connection between the two lines through another person.\n\nWait, \"Alice is Douglas's descendant.\" So Douglas → Alice.\n\nAnd \"Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\" So Alice → Michelle.\n\nBut in the Madison line, we have Douglas coming from the Shirley line: Shirley → ... → Douglas.\n\nWait, Shirley's line goes to Douglas, then Alice, then Michelle.\n\nMadison's line doesn't go through Douglas. So the Shirley line connects to Alice, who is in the Shirley line's chain, but Madison's line doesn't connect to Alice.\n\nWait, but \"Alice is Douglas's descendant\" → Douglas → Alice.\n\nAnd \"Douglas is Austin's descendant\" → Austin → Douglas.\n\n\"Austin is Rachel's descendant\" → Rachel → Austin.\n\n\"Rachel is Donald's descendant\" → Donald → Rachel.\n\n\"Donald is Scott's descendant\" → Scott → Donald.\n\n\"Scott is Sophia's descendant\" → Sophia → Scott.\n\n\"Sophia is Kevin's descendant\" → Kevin → Sophia.\n\n\"Kevin\" is in Shirley's line.\n\nSo Shirley's line leads to Kevin, then Sophia, etc., all the way to Douglas, Alice, Michelle, etc.\n\nMadison's line leads to Melissa.\n\nIs there a connection between Melissa and anyone in Shirley's line?\n\nIn Madison's line, Joyce → Melissa.\n\nIn Shirley's line, we have Joyce? No, Joyce is only in Madison's line.\n\nWait, unless \"Joyce is Joan's descendant\" and Joan is in Madison's line, but Shirley's line doesn't reach Joan.\n\nSo, unless there's another path.\n\nWait, let's check if \"Joyce\" appears elsewhere. The only mention is \"Joyce is Joan's descendant\" and \"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\"\n\nSo Joyce is only in Madison's line.\n\nNow, the question is about Madison and Shirley. Do they have a relationship?\n\nWe need to see if Madison is an ancestor of Shirley, descendant, share common ancestor, common descendant, or none.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Is Madison an ancestor of Shirley? For that, Shirley would have to be in Madison's descendant line.\n\nMadison's descendants: Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa.\n\nShirley is not in that list.\n\n- Is Shirley an ancestor of Madison? Then Madison would be in Shirley's descendant line.\n\nShirley's descendants: Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George.\n\nMadison is not in that list.\n\nSo they don't have a direct ancestor-descendant relationship.\n\nDo they share a common ancestor?\n\nA common ancestor would be someone who is an ancestor of both Madison and Shirley.\n\nTo find that, we need to see if there's a person X such that X is an ancestor of Madison and X is an ancestor of Shirley.\n\nSimilarly, common descendant would be someone who is a descendant of both.\n\nLet's try to find a common ancestor.\n\nFirst, let's trace back from Madison.\n\nMadison's ancestors: Not directly given, but we can see if there's someone who is an ancestor of Madison.\n\nWait, the given relationships are all from the list. We have to assume that the given relationships are the only ones we can use.\n\nWait, the problem states \"Given the following lineage relationships,\" so we can only use those to infer.\n\nSo to find a common ancestor, we need to see if there's a person who is an ancestor of both Madison and Shirley.\n\nBut we don't have direct info on Madison's ancestors. The only info is that Harold is Madison's descendant, so Madison's descendant is Harold. To find Madison's ancestors, we'd need someone who is an ancestor of Madison, but none of the given relationships state that.\n\nWait, actually, all the relationships given are either ancestor-descendant pairs. So to find Madison's ancestors, we'd need someone who has Madison as a descendant, but the list doesn't say that. The only thing we know about Madison is that Harold is her descendant.\n\nSimilarly, Shirley's ancestors: We know Evelyn is Shirley's descendant, so Shirley's descendants include Evelyn, but Shirley's ancestors aren't directly stated.\n\nWait, but to find a common ancestor, we need someone who is an ancestor of both Madison and Shirley.\n\nBut without knowing Madison's ancestors or Shirley's ancestors, how can we tell?\n\nWait, but maybe through the chains.\n\nWait, let's consider the Shirley line. The Shirley line goes back to... well, Shirley is the starting point. The Shirley line as we traced goes to George, but Shirley herself is the ancestor of Evelyn.\n\nSimilarly, Madison's line starts with Madison as the ancestor of Harold.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a person who is an ancestor of both.\n\nWait, let's see if the two lines ever meet.\n\nMadison's descendants: Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa.\n\nShirley's descendants: Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George.\n\nNo overlap in descendants. So no common descendant.\n\nFor common ancestor: Is there a person who is an ancestor of both Madison and Shirley?\n\nTo find that, we'd need to see if there's a person X such that X is an ancestor of Madison and X is an ancestor of Shirley.\n\nBut we don't have direct info on Madison's ancestors. The only way is if through some chain.\n\nWait, but Madison's ancestors would have to be someone who is an ancestor of Madison, but the given relationships don't state that. For example, if someone is listed as an ancestor of Madison, but I don't see any such statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the list:\n\n- Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\n\n- Eugene is Samantha's ancestor.\n\n- Doris is Aaron's descendant.\n\nEtc.\n\nNo one is stated as an ancestor of Madison. Similarly, Shirley's ancestors aren't stated.\n\nSo unless through a chain.\n\nWait, but if we consider that all these relationships form a graph, we might have to see if there's a path from Madison to Shirley or vice versa, but since we need a common ancestor, we need a node that connects to both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe through another person.\n\nWait, let's consider the person \"Alice\" who is in Shirley's line.\n\nAlice is in Shirley's line (as part of the chain from Shirley to Alice), and Alice is also an ancestor of Michelle, etc.\n\nBut Madison's line doesn't include Alice.\n\nWait, but let's see if Alice is a descendant of Madison or something. Not that we know.\n\nWait, another angle: Let's look for any mention of \"Madison\" or \"Shirley\" in other relationships.\n\n\"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" So Madison → Harold.\n\n\"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" Wait, no: \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" → Madison is ancestor.\n\n\"Shirley is the ancestor of Evelyn.\"\n\nNo other mentions.\n\nWait, another entry: \"Charlotte is Carol's ancestor.\" Not related.\n\n\"Patricia is Carol's descendant.\" Not related.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe we can find a chain from Madison to Shirley or vice versa.\n\nMadison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → Anthony → Mason → James → Karen → Brian → Lawrence → Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara → Nicole → Elijah → Kevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nIs there any overlap between these two chains?\n\nLooking at the names:\n\nMadison's chain: Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa.\n\nShirley's chain: Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George.\n\nNo common names. So the two chains don't intersect.\n\nTherefore, Madison and Shirley don't have a direct ancestor-descendant relationship, and they don't share a common ancestor or descendant based on the given information.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check if \"Margaret\" is in both lines.\n\nMadison's line: Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → ... Margaret is in Shirley's line.\n\nWait, \"Margaret is Judy's ancestor\" and \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant.\"\n\nIn Madison's line, Margaret is not present. In Shirley's line, Margaret is present.\n\nSo no overlap.\n\nAnother check: \"Brian\" is in Madison's line (Karen → Brian), and \"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\"\n\nIn Shirley's line, no mention of Brian.\n\n\"Lawrence\" is in Madison's line (Brian → Lawrence), and Lawrence is Marie's ancestor.\n\nNo connection to Shirley.\n\nWait, \"Lawrence is Marie's ancestor\" and \"Marie is Joan's ancestor,\" etc.\n\nShirley's line has no connection to Marie.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let's consider if there's a common ancestor through another path.\n\nWait, \"Alice is Douglas's descendant\" and \"Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Michelle is Betty's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Daniel is Margaret's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Judy is Christina's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Christina is Bradley's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Bradley is Ralph's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Ralph is Jack's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Jack is Eugene's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Eugene is Samantha's ancestor.\"\n\n\"George is Samantha's descendant.\"\n\nSo that's the Shirley line.\n\nMadison's line:\n\n\"Harold is Madison's descendant.\"\n\n\"Jordan is Harold's descendant.\"\n\n\"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Noah is Timothy's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Timothy is Matthew's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Matthew is Mary's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Mary is Janet's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Janet is Katherine's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Katherine is Dorothy's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Dorothy is Brandon's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Brandon is Anthony's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Anthony is Mason's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Mason is James's ancestor.\"\n\n\"James is Karen's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Karen is Brian's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Lawrence is Marie's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Marie is Joan's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Joan is Joyce's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\"\n\nSo Madison's line ends at Melissa.\n\nNow, is there any way that the Shirley line connects to Madison's line?\n\nWait, \"Douglas is Austin's descendant\" and \"Alice is Douglas's descendant,\" so Alice is a descendant of Douglas.\n\nBut Madison's line doesn't go through Douglas.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's a person who is in both lines.\n\nWait, I don't see any common names. So unless...\n\nWait, \"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor\" and \"Daniel is Margaret's ancestor\" in Shirley's line.\n\nIn Madison's line, \"Hannah\" isn't present.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe \"Evelyn\" is connected to someone in Madison's line.\n\nEvelyn is Shirley's descendant. \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" → Shirley → Evelyn.\n\n\"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant.\"\n\n\"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\"\n\nBut Theresa is not in Madison's line.\n\nWait, unless...\n\nWait, \"Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\" And \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant.\"\n\nBut no connection to Madison.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the answer is that they share a common ancestor, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, let's think if there's a person who is an ancestor of both Madison and Shirley.\n\nFor example, if someone is an ancestor of Madison and also an ancestor of Shirley.\n\nBut since we don't have Madison's ancestors listed, maybe through a chain.\n\nWait, but to have a common ancestor, there must be a person X such that X is an ancestor of Madison and X is an ancestor of Shirley.\n\nBut since we don't have any information about Madison's ancestors, unless X is someone who is an ancestor of Shirley and also an ancestor of Madison.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, let's assume that all the relationships given form a tree or a graph, and we need to see if there's a common node.\n\nBut given the information, it's possible that Madison and Shirley are in separate branches with no common ancestor.\n\nBut wait, the problem might have a trick.\n\nWait, let's look for \"Shirley\" and \"Madison\" in other relationships.\n\nWait, \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\"\n\n\"Jordan is Harold's descendant.\"\n\n\"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Timothy is Noah's descendant.\"\n\n\"Matthew is Timothy's descendant.\"\n\n\"Matthew is Mary's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Mary is Janet's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Katherine is Janet's descendant.\"\n\n\"Dorothy is Katherine's descendant.\"\n\n\"Brandon is Dorothy's descendant.\"\n\n\"Brandon is Anthony's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Mason is Anthony's descendant.\"\n\n\"James is Mason's descendant.\"\n\n\"James is Karen's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Karen is Brian's descendant.\"\n\n\"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Lawrence is Marie's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Marie is Joan's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Joan is Joyce's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\"\n\nSo Madison's line ends at Melissa.\n\nShirley's line:\n\n\"Shirley is Evelyn's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Evelyn is Theresa's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Peter is Barbara's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Barbara is Nicole's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Nicole is Elijah's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Elijah is Kevin's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Kevin is Sophia's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Sophia is Scott's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Scott is Donald's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Donald is Rachel's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Rachel is Austin's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Austin is Douglas's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Douglas is Alice's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Michelle is Betty's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Daniel is Margaret's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Judy is Christina's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Christina is Bradley's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Bradley is Ralph's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Ralph is Jack's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Jack is Eugene's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Eugene is Samantha's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Samantha is George's ancestor.\"\n\nNow, is there any overlap between the two chains?\n\nWait, \"Margaret\" appears in Shirley's line as Margaret is Judy's ancestor, but in Madison's line, we have \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant,\" but Daniel is in Shirley's line.\n\nWait, no: In Shirley's line, Daniel is an ancestor of Margaret (Hannah → Daniel → Margaret).\n\nIn Madison's line, Margaret isn't present.\n\nWait, but \"Margaret is Judy's ancestor\" in Shirley's line.\n\nWait, let's take a step back.\n\nLet's list all the people in both chains:\n\nMadison's descendants (in order):\n\nMadison → Harold → Jordan → Noah → Timothy → Matthew → Mary → Janet → Katherine → Dorothy → Brandon → Anthony → Mason → James → Karen → Brian → Lawrence → Marie → Joan → Joyce → Melissa.\n\nShirley's descendants:\n\nShirley → Evelyn → Theresa → Peter → Barbara → Nicole → Elijah → Kevin → Sophia → Scott → Donald → Rachel → Austin → Douglas → Alice → Michelle → Betty → Hannah → Daniel → Margaret → Judy → Christina → Bradley → Ralph → Jack → Eugene → Samantha → George.\n\nNow, let's see if any of the names in Madison's list appear in Shirley's list.\n\nMadison's list: Madison, Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa.\n\nShirley's list: Shirley, Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George.\n\nNo overlapping names. So the two chains are completely separate.\n\nTherefore, Madison and Shirley don't share a common ancestor or descendant based on the given information. So the answer would be 5. None of the above.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check for any possible missed connections.\n\nWait, \"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor\" in Shirley's line.\n\nAnd \"Michelle is Betty's ancestor,\" \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\"\n\nSo Michelle → Betty → Hannah.\n\nIn Madison's line, there's no Michelle.\n\nWait, but what about \"Alice\" in Shirley's line. Alice is a descendant of Douglas, etc.\n\nIs there any mention of Alice in Madison's line? No.\n\nWait, \"Alice is Michelle's ancestor,\" so Alice is an ancestor in Shirley's line.\n\nBut Madison's line doesn't include Alice.\n\nAnother check: \"Lawrence is Marie's ancestor\" and \"Marie is Joan's ancestor\" in Madison's line.\n\nIn Shirley's line, no Marie.\n\nWait, \"Marie\" is only in Madison's line.\n\n\"Judy\" is in Shirley's line (\"Margaret is Judy's ancestor\"), and Judy is Christina's ancestor.\n\nBut Judy doesn't appear in Madison's line.\n\nI think it's safe to say there's no connection between the two lines.\n\nTherefore, Madison and Shirley don't have an ancestor-descendant relationship, and they don't share a common ancestor or descendant based on the given information.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 5. None of the above.\n\nWait, but let's check the options again:\n\n1. Madison is Shirley's ancestor.\n\n2. Madison is Shirley's descendant.\n\n3. Madison and Shirley share a common ancestor.\n\n4. Madison and Shirley share a common descendant.\n\n5. None of the above.\n\nSince they don't have a direct relationship, and no common ancestor or descendant, answer 5.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let's make sure.\n\nWait, \"Harold is Madison's descendant,\" so Madison is ancestor of Harold.\n\n\"Jordan is Harold's descendant,\" so Harold is ancestor of Jordan.\n\n\"Jordan is Noah's ancestor,\" so Jordan is ancestor of Noah.\n\n\"Timothy is Noah's descendant,\" so Noah is ancestor of Timothy.\n\n\"Matthew is Timothy's descendant,\" so Timothy is ancestor of Matthew.\n\n\"Matthew is Mary's ancestor,\" so Matthew is ancestor of Mary.\n\n\"Mary is Janet's ancestor,\" so Mary is ancestor of Janet.\n\n\"Katherine is Janet's descendant,\" so Janet is ancestor of Katherine.\n\n\"Dorothy is Katherine's descendant,\" so Katherine is ancestor of Dorothy.\n\n\"Brandon is Dorothy's descendant,\" so Dorothy is ancestor of Brandon.\n\n\"Brandon is Anthony's ancestor,\" so Brandon is ancestor of Anthony.\n\n\"Mason is Anthony's descendant,\" so Anthony is ancestor of Mason.\n\n\"James is Mason's descendant,\" so Mason is ancestor of James.\n\n\"James is Karen's ancestor,\" so James is ancestor of Karen.\n\n\"Brian is Karen's descendant,\" so Karen is ancestor of Brian.\n\n\"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor,\" so Brian is ancestor of Lawrence.\n\n\"Lawrence is Marie's ancestor,\" so Lawrence is ancestor of Marie.\n\n\"Marie is Joan's ancestor,\" so Marie is ancestor of Joan.\n\n\"Joan is Joyce's ancestor,\" so Joan is ancestor of Joyce.\n\n\"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor,\" so Joyce is ancestor of Melissa.\n\nSo Madison's line goes all the way to Melissa.\n\nShirley's line:\n\n\"Shirley is Evelyn's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Evelyn is Theresa's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Peter is Barbara's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Barbara is Nicole's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Nicole is Elijah's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Elijah is Kevin's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Kevin is Sophia's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Sophia is Scott's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Scott is Donald's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Donald is Rachel's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Rachel is Austin's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Austin is Douglas's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Douglas is Alice's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Michelle is Betty's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Daniel is Margaret's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Judy is Christina's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Christina is Bradley's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Bradley is Ralph's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Ralph is Jack's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Jack is Eugene's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Eugene is Samantha's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Samantha is George's ancestor.\"\n\nNow, is there any person who is both in Madison's line and Shirley's line?
