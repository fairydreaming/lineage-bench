We need to determine the relationship between Scott and Doris based on these relationships.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. Scott is Rachel's descendant. Means Scott is a descendant of Rachel, or Rachel is an ancestor of Scott. So: Rachel -> ... -> Scott.\n\n2. Kevin is Walter's descendant. So Walter is ancestor of Kevin.\n\n3. Jesse is Kevin's descendant. So Kevin is ancestor of Jesse? Wait careful: \"Jesse is Kevin's descendant.\" That means Jesse is descendant of Kevin, so Kevin is ancestor of Jesse. So: Kevin -> Jesse.\n\n4. Rachel is Jesse's descendant. Means Rachel is descendant of Jesse, so Jesse is ancestor of Rachel. So: Jesse -> Rachel.\n\n5. Helen is Jacob's descendant. So Jacob is ancestor of Helen.\n\n6. Helen is Doris's ancestor. So Helen is ancestor of Doris. So: Helen -> ... -> Doris.\n\n7. Walter is Jacob's ancestor. So Walter is ancestor of Jacob. So: Walter -> ... -> Jacob.\n\nWe need to determine the relationship between Scott and Doris.\n\nLet's summarize relationships as directed edges from ancestor to descendant (A -> D means A is ancestor of D).\n\nFrom given:\n\n- Rachel -> Scott (since Scott is Rachel's descendant, that is Rachel ancestor of Scott). Actually careful: \"Scott is Rachel's descendant.\" So Rachel is ancestor of Scott? Yes, if Scott is Rachel's descendant, then Rachel is an ancestor of Scott. So ancestor: Rachel, descendant: Scott.\n\nThus: Rachel -> Scott.\n\n- Walter -> Kevin (since Kevin is Walter's descendant, Walter is ancestor of Kevin). So Walter -> Kevin.\n\n- Kevin -> Jesse (since Jesse is Kevin's descendant). So Kevin -> Jesse.\n\n- Jesse -> Rachel (since Rachel is Jesse's descendant). So Jesse -> Rachel.\n\n- Jacob -> Helen (since Helen is Jacob's descendant). So Jacob -> Helen.\n\n- Helen -> Doris (since Helen is Doris's ancestor). So Helen -> Doris.\n\n- Walter -> Jacob (since Walter is Jacob's ancestor). So Walter -> Jacob.\n\nSo we have a directed graph representing ancestry. We need to see how Scott and Doris are related: possibly they share a common ancestor, or one is ancestor of the other, or maybe none.\n\nLet's map out the chain.\n\nWe have connections:\n\nScott: from Rachel -> Scott.\n\nRachel: from Jesse -> Rachel.\n\nJesse: from Kevin -> Jesse.\n\nKevin: from Walter -> Kevin.\n\nAlso, Walter -> Jacob -> Helen -> Doris.\n\nWait, we also have Walter -> Jacob (ancestor of Jacob). So Walter is ancestor of Jacob. Then Jacob is ancestor of Helen, and Helen is ancestor of Doris.\n\nThus we have:\n\nWalter -> Kevin -> Jesse -> Rachel -> Scott\n\nand\n\nWalter -> Jacob -> Helen -> Doris.\n\nSo Walter is a common ancestor of both Scott and Doris.\n\nNow, what is the exact relationship? Since Walter is common ancestor to both, they share a common ancestor.\n\nBut check also if maybe Scott is ancestor of Doris or descendant? From the chains, Scott is descendant of Walter, and Doris is descendant of Walter. They are on separate branches: Scott via Kevin, Jesse, Rachel; Doris via Jacob, Helen.\n\nSo they are not directly in line; they are not ancestor/descendant of each other (unless there is some other connection not given). So they share a common ancestor (Walter). But also maybe they share a common descendant? That would mean there is some person who is descendant of both Scott and Doris. We don't have any info about that. So not 1.\n\nScott is Doris's ancestor? That would require a path from Scott to Doris. Is there? Scott is descendant of Rachel, Jesse, Kevin, Walter, etc. To be ancestor of Doris, we would need Scott -> ... -> Doris. But we have Walter -> Jacob -> Helen -> Doris. Scott is downstream from Walter, so Scott is lower (more recent) than Walter. Could Scott be an ancestor of Doris? That would mean Doris is descendant of Scott, which would require a path from Scott to Doris. But we have no such path; Scott is in a branch that goes: Walter->Kevin->Jesse->Rachel->Scott. Doris is in: Walter->Jacob->Helen->Doris. So no direct line. However, it's possible that Scott is an ancestor of Doris if there is an additional link not given, but none present. So not 2.\n\nScott is Doris's descendant? That would require Doris is ancestor of Scott, so path Doris -> ... -> Scott. But Doris is descendant of Helen, Jacob, Walter. So Doris is also downstream from Walter. To be ancestor of Scott, Doris would have to be on a path to Scott. But Scott is on the other branch: Walter->Kevin->Jesse->Rachel->Scott. Doris is on Walter->Jacob->Helen->Doris. So no path from Doris to Scott either. So not 4.\n\nThus they share a common ancestor: Walter. So answer should be 3: Scott and Doris share a common ancestor.\n\nBut check if there is any nuance: The relationships are given as statements about lineage. Are we sure about direction? Let's re-read:\n\n* Scott is Rachel's descendant. That means Rachel is ancestor of Scott? Yes.\n\n* Kevin is Walter's descendant. So Walter ancestor of Kevin.\n\n* Jesse is Kevin's descendant. So Kevin ancestor of Jesse.\n\n* Rachel is Jesse's descendant. So Jesse ancestor of Rachel.\n\n* Helen is Jacob's descendant. So Jacob ancestor of Helen.\n\n* Helen is Doris's ancestor. So Helen ancestor of Doris.\n\n* Walter is Jacob's ancestor. So Walter ancestor of Jacob.\n\nThus Walter is ancestor of both Kevin and Jacob. So common ancestor indeed.\n\nBut also note that \"ancestor\" and \"descendant\" are transitive. So from Walter to Kevin to Jesse to Rachel to Scott, Walter is ancestor of Scott. And from Walter to Jacob to Helen to Doris, Walter is ancestor of Doris.\n\nThus common ancestor is Walter.\n\nBut could there be other common ancestors? Possibly also Jacob? But Jacob is ancestor of Helen and Doris, but is Jacob ancestor of Scott? Let's check: Jacob is descendant of Walter? Actually Walter is ancestor of Jacob, but Jacob is not ancestor of Scott because we have no path from Jacob to Scott. Could be if Jacob is also ancestor of Kevin or something? No. So Walter is the common.\n\nThus answer is 3.\n\nBut check if \"share a common ancestor\" might be considered true if they have any common ancestor; yes.\n\nNow check other options:\n\n1. Share a common descendant: means there is some person who is descendant of both Scott and Doris. Not given; possibly unknown, but from info we cannot infer such. So not necessarily true.\n\n5. None of the above is correct. No, 3 is correct.\n\nSo answer is <ANSWER>3</ANSWER>.\n\nBut let's verify if there is any trick: Could it be that \"descendant\" and \"ancestor\" might be misinterpreted? For example, \"Scott is Rachel's descendant\" could mean Scott is a descendant of Rachel, which is the same as Rachel is an ancestor of Scott. So okay.\n\nAlso, \"Helen is Doris's ancestor\" means Helen is ancestor of Doris. So correct.\n\nNow, we must ensure no cycles. The relationships are consistent? Let's check: Walter -> Kevin -> Jesse -> Rachel -> Scott. Also Walter -> Jacob -> Helen -> Doris. That's fine.\n\nCould there be any other relationship inferred that might make Scott ancestor of Doris? For instance, if we combine some statements maybe we can get Scott -> something -> Doris? No.\n\nBut wait: Let's consider if any of the given relationships might be interpreted in reverse: For example, \"Scott is Rachel's descendant.\" That is unambiguous.\n\nThus answer is 3.\n\nOne might also consider that \"common ancestor\" means at least one ancestor that is common. That is Walter. So correct.\n\nThus final answer: 3.\n\nBut let's double-check the chain: Walter -> Kevin, Kevin -> Jesse, Jesse -> Rachel, Rachel -> Scott. So Scott is descendant of Walter. Similarly, Walter -> Jacob, Jacob -> Helen, Helen -> Doris, so Doris is descendant of Walter. So they share Walter as common ancestor.
