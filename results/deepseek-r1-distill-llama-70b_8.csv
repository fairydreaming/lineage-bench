2. **Hannah** is Amber's ancestor → Amber is a descendant of Hannah.
3. **Emily** is Beverly's ancestor → Beverly is a descendant of Emily.
4. **Beverly** is Hannah's ancestor → Hannah is a descendant of Beverly.
5. **Dorothy** is Doris's ancestor → Doris is a descendant of Dorothy.
6. **Amber** is Dorothy's descendant → Amber is a descendant of Dorothy.
7. **Alexander** is Emily's descendant → Alexander is a descendant of Emily.

### Constructing the Family Tree:
- **Dorothy** is the oldest ancestor.
  - **Dorothy → Doris → Keith** (Keith's lineage).
  - **Dorothy → Emily → Beverly → Hannah → Amber** (Amber's lineage).
  - **Emily → Alexander** (Alexander's lineage).

### Relationship Between Keith and Alexander:
- Both Keith and Alexander are descendants of **Dorothy**, but they belong to different branches of the family tree (Keith under Doris and Alexander under Emily).
- There is no direct ancestor-descendant relationship between Keith and Alexander; however, they share a common ancestor in Dorothy.

### Evaluation of Options:
1. **Keith and Alexander share a common descendant**: Incorrect, as there is no evidence they have a common descendant.
2. **Keith is Alexander's ancestor**: Incorrect, as Keith and Alexander are on different branches.
3. **Keith and Alexander share a common ancestor**: Correct, as both are descendants of Dorothy.
4. **Keith is Alexander's descendant**: Incorrect, as Keith is not in Alexander's lineage.
5. **None of the above is correct**: Incorrect, as option 3 is correct.

1. **Victoria's Lineage**:  
   - Victoria is Kayla's descendant.  
   - Kayla is Lauren's descendant.  
   - Lauren is Julie's descendant.  
   - Julie is Patricia's descendant.  
   - Patricia is Lori's descendant.  
   - Lori is Logan's descendant.  

   This establishes that Victoria is a descendant of Logan through the lineage: Logan → Lori → Patricia → Julie → Lauren → Kayla → Victoria.

2. **Joseph's Lineage**:  
   - Logan is Joseph's ancestor, meaning Joseph is a descendant of Logan.

3. **Common Ancestor**:  
   Both Victoria and Joseph are descendants of Logan, making Logan their common ancestor. However, Victoria and Joseph are in different branches of Logan's descendants (Victoria through Lori and Joseph through another branch). Therefore, they do not share a direct ancestor-descendant relationship with each other.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option 1**: Victoria and Joseph share a common ancestor. This is correct because both are descendants of Logan.  
   - **Option 2**: Victoria and Joseph share a common descendant. This is incorrect because there is no information suggesting they share a common descendant.  
   - **Option 3**: Victoria is Joseph's descendant. This is incorrect because Victoria is in a different branch of Logan's descendants and not directly descended from Joseph.  
   - **Option 4**: Victoria is Joseph's ancestor. This is incorrect because Victoria is a descendant of Logan, not an ancestor of Joseph.  
   - **Option 5**: None of the above is correct. This is incorrect because Option 1 is correct.

    - **Tyler** is a descendant of Emily.
      - **Logan** is a descendant of Tyler.
        - **Roy** is a descendant of Logan.

### Constructing the Lineage
From the above relationships, we can build the following lineage:

- **Main Line**: Carl → Dorothy → Frances → Kathryn → Ronald → Peter → Jonathan.
- **Jordan's Line**: Jordan → Jonathan.

### Key Observations
- Jonathan is a descendant of both Peter and Jordan, meaning both Peter and Jordan are ancestors of Jonathan.
- Since Peter is already in the main line (Carl → Dorothy → ... → Peter → Jonathan), Jordan must also be part of this lineage as an ancestor of Peter.
- Therefore, Jordan must be an ancestor of Carl, as Carl is the ancestor of Dorothy, who is the ancestor of Frances, Kathryn, Ronald, and ultimately Peter and Jonathan.

### Conclusion
Since Jordan is an ancestor of Peter, and Peter is a descendant of Carl, Jordan must be an ancestor of Carl. This makes Carl a descendant of Jordan.

1. **Cynthia is Douglas's descendant**: Douglas → Cynthia.
2. **Cynthia is Matthew's descendant**: Matthew → Cynthia.
3. **Linda is Russell's ancestor**: Linda → Russell.
4. **Katherine is Hannah's descendant**: Hannah → Katherine.
5. **Russell is Hannah's ancestor**: Russell → Hannah.
