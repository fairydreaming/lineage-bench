List the given lineage relationships:**\n\n*   Carl is Bradley's ancestor. (Carl -> ... -> Bradley)\n*   Theresa is Carl's ancestor. (Theresa -> ... -> Carl)\n*   Bradley is Brittany's ancestor.

Trace Albert's lineage upwards:**\n\n*   Brittany is Albert's ancestor.\n*   Bradley is Brittany's ancestor.\n*   Carl is Bradley's ancestor.\n*   Theresa is Carl's ancestor.\n\nSo, Albert's lineage is: **Theresa -> ... -> Carl -> ... -> Bradley -> ... -> Brittany -> ... -> Albert**\n\n**3. Trace Kenneth's lineage upwards:**\n\n*   Christian is Kenneth's ancestor.\n*   Jessica is Christian's ancestor.\n*   Theresa is Jessica's ancestor.\n\nSo, Kenneth's lineage is: **Theresa -> ... -> Jessica -> ... -> Christian -> ... -> Kenneth**\n\n**4. Compare the two lineages to find a connection:**\n\n*   Albert's lineage starts with Theresa.\n*   Kenneth's lineage starts with Theresa.\n\nThis means Theresa is an ancestor to both Albert and Kenneth.\n\n**5. Analyze the options based on the finding:**\n\n*   Therais is a common ancestor for Albert and Kenneth.\n\n*   **Option 1: Albert and Kenneth share a common ancestor.**\n    *   This is correct. The common ancestor is Theresa.\n\n*   **Option 2: Albert and Kenneth share a common descendant.**\n    *   This would mean there is someone who is a descendant of *both* Albert and Kenneth. The given information doesn't support this, and based on the relationships, they are in different branches descending from Theresa. So, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option 3: Albert is Kenneth's ancestor.**\n    *   This is incorrect. Their lineages diverge at Theresa. Albert is a descendant of Bradley, who is a descendant of Carl, who is a descendant of Theresa. Kenneth is a descendant of Christian, who is a descendant of Jessica, who is a descendant of Theresa. There is no direct line from Albert to Kenneth or vice-versa that would make one the ancestor of the other.\n\n*   **Option 4: Albert is Kenneth's descendant.**\n    *   This is also incorrect for the same reason as above.\n\n*   **Option 5: None of the above is correct.**\n    *   This is incorrect because Option 1 is correct.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n\n*   I've established that Theresa is a common ancestor of both Albert and Kenneth.\n*   Therefore, the correct statement is that Albert and Kenneth share a common ancestor.\n*   This corresponds to option 1.\n\n**Final Check:**\n*   A -> B means A is ancestor of B.\n*   Given: T->C, C->B, B->Br, Br->Al  => T -> C -> B -> Br -> Al\n*   Given: T->J, J->Ch, Ch->K         => T -> J -> Ch -> K\n*   Both lines start with Theresa (T).
