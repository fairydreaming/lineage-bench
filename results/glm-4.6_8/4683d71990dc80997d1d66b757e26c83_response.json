(Jessica -> ... -> Christian)\n    *   Brittany is Albert's ancestor. (Brittany -> ... -> Albert)\n\n*   **Goal:** Find the relationship between Albert and Kenneth.\n\n*   **Options:**\n    1.  Albert and Kenneth share a common ancestor.\n    2.  Albert and Kenneth share a common descendant.\n    3.  Albert is Kenneth's ancestor.\n    4.  Albert is Kenneth's descendant.\n    5.  None of the above is correct.\n\n**2. Trace the Lineage for Albert:**\n\n*   Brittany is Albert's ancestor. (Brittany -> ... -> Albert)\n*   Bradley is Brittany's ancestor. (Bradley -> ... -> Brittany -> ... -> Albert)\n*   Carl is Bradley's ancestor. (Carl -> ... -> Bradley -> ... -> Brittany -> ... -> Albert)\n*   Theresa is Carl's ancestor. (Theresa -> ... -> Carl -> ... -> Bradley -> ... -> Brittany -> ... -> Albert)\n\nSo, Albert's lineage is: **Theresa -> Carl -> Bradley -> Brittany -> Albert**\n\n**3.

(Jessica -> ... -> Christian -> ... -> Kenneth)\n*   Theresa is Jessica's ancestor. (Theresa -> ... -> Jessica -> ... -> Christian -> ... -> Kenneth)\n\nSo, Kenneth's lineage is: **Theresa -> Jessica -> Christian -> Kenneth**\n\n**4. Compare the Two Lineages:**\n\n*   Albert's lineage: Theresa -> Carl -> Bradley -> Brittany -> Albert\n*   Kenneth's lineage: Theresa -> Jessica -> Christian -> Kenneth\n\n**5. Analyze the Comparison:**\n\n*   The first person in both lineages is **Theresa**.\n*   This means Theresa is an ancestor to both Albert and Kenneth.\n*   Therefore, Albert and Kenneth share a common ancestor, which is Theresa.\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options:**\n\n*   **1. Albert and Kenneth share a common ancestor.**\n    *   This is correct. Theresa is the common ancestor.\n\n*   **2. Albert and Kenneth share a common descendant.**\n    *   This is incorrect. There is no information linking Albert and Kenneth as ancestors to the same person.\n\n*   **3. Albert is Kenneth's ancestor.**\n    *   This is incorrect. Their lineages diverge at Theresa. Albert is in one branch, Kenneth is in another.\n\n*   **4. Albert is Kenneth's descendant.**\n    *   This is incorrect. Again, their lineages diverge at Theresa.\n\n*   **5.
