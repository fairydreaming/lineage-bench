Therefore, **Sara is Linda's ancestor**. (Sara → ... → Noah → ... → Linda)\n    *   From (3): Jacob is Linda's descendant, which means Linda is Jacob's ancestor. Combining this with the previous step: Sara is Linda's ancestor, and Linda is Jacob's ancestor. Therefore, **Sara is Jacob's ancestor**. (Sara → ... → Linda → ... → Jacob)\n    *   From (4): Jacob is Carolyn's ancestor. Combining this: Sara is Jacob's ancestor, and Jacob is Carolyn's ancestor. Therefore, **Sara is Carolyn's ancestor**. (Sara → ... → Jacob → ... → Carolyn)\n    *   From (6): Walter is Carolyn's descendant, which means Carolyn is Walter's ancestor. Combining this: Sara is Carolyn's ancestor, and Carolyn is Walter's ancestor. Therefore, **Sara is Walter's ancestor**.

Option 1 is more precise. In these types of logic puzzles, the most specific and direct relationship is usually the intended answer. Let's re-read the question. \"Determine the lineage relationship\". \"Sara is Julie's ancestor\" is a direct lineage relationship. \"Sara and Julie share a common ancestor\" is also true, but less specific. If Sara is Julie's ancestor, then they automatically share a common ancestor (Sara herself). However, if they just shared a common ancestor (e.g., both are descendants of Noah), it wouldn't mean Sara is Julie's ancestor.
