Samantha and Donald share a common ancestor. (False. Samantha is at the \"oldest\" end we know of, Donald is at the \"youngest\". Samantha is an ancestor of Donald. They cannot share a common ancestor unless there's someone older than Samantha who is also an ancestor of Donald, which would still make Samantha an ancestor of Donald.

Samantha is Donald's ancestor. (True. The lineage is Samantha -> ... -> Donald).\n    *   5. None of the above is correct.

The relationship is direct and unambiguous based on the provided facts. Option 4 is the correct description. Option 2 (\"share a common ancestor\") is technically true (they could share any ancestor of Samantha, including Douglas, Megan, etc.), but Option 4 (\"Samantha is Donald's ancestor\") is a more specific and accurate description of their direct relationship. In these types of logic puzzles, the most specific correct answer is usually the intended one. So, 4 is better than 2. Let's check the phrasing again. \"share a common ancestor\" implies they are on different branches of a family tree stemming from a common root. But here, they are on the *same branch* of the tree. So, 2 is not a good description. 4 is perfect.
