Therefore, Janet is a direct ancestor of Frances.\n\nThis means that Frances is a direct descendant of Janet.\n\nLet's review the options:\n1.  Frances is Janet's descendant. (Correct)\n2.  Frances and Janet share a common descendant. (True, but not the most direct relationship).\n3.  Frances and Janet share a common ancestor. (False).\n4.  Frances is Janet's ancestor. (False).\n5.  None of the above is correct.
