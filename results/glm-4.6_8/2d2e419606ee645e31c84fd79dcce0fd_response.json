This is false. We found that `Lawrence` is an ancestor to both, but they are on separate branches from him. Christine is not on Alice's direct line of descent.\n3.  **Christine is Alice's ancestor.** This would mean `Christine -> ... -> Alice`. This is also false for the same reason.\n4.  **Christine and Alice share a common ancestor.** We found that Lawrence is a common ancestor to both.
