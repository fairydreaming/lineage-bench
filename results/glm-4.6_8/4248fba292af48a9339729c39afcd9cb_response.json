This means Michelle and Ryan/Rachel are both ancestors of Henry. They could be the same person, or one could be an ancestor of the other, or they could be unrelated ancestors. Let's keep this in mind.\n\n*   From `Jean is Michelle's ancestor`:\n    *   Jean -> Michelle.\n    *   Now we can combine this with the previous chain: `Jean -> Michelle -> Henry`.\n    *   We also have `Ryan -> Rachel -> Henry`.\n    *   So, Jean and Ryan/Rachel are both ancestors of Henry.\n\n*   Let's look at the other side of the tree.\n*   From `Kayla is Keith's ancestor` and `Jean is Keith's descendant`:\n    *   Kayla -> Keith -> Jean\n\n*   Now we can connect the two parts of the tree using Jean.\n    *   We have `Kayla -> Keith -> Jean`.\n    *   We also have `Jean -> Michelle -> Henry`.\n    *   Combining these gives a nice long chain:\n    *   `Kayla -> Keith -> Jean -> Michelle -> Henry`\n\n*   Now let's bring in Ryan and Rachel.\n    *   We have `Ryan -> Rachel -> Henry`.\n    *   We also know `Jean -> Michelle -> Henry`.\n    *   This means Jean and Ryan/Rachel are both ancestors of Henry. We don't know the relationship between Jean and Ryan/Rachel yet.\n\n*   Let's use the last piece of information: `Ryan is Gloria's descendant`.\n    *   This means `Gloria -> Ryan`.\n    *   Now we can extend the Ryan chain:\n    *   `Gloria -> Ryan -> Rachel -> Henry`\n\n*   So now we have two main chains leading to Henry:\n    1.  `Kayla -> Keith -> Jean -> Michelle -> Henry`\n    2.  `Gloria -> Ryan -> Rachel -> Henry`\n\n*   We still don't know the relationship between the two chains. Let's re-read all the statements to see if I missed a link.\n    *   Rachel is Henry's ancestor. (Used)\n    *   Kayla is Keith's ancestor. (Used)\n    *   Henry is Michelle's descendant.

This means the two chains are distinct *except* for their common descendant, Henry.\n    *   Chain 1: `Kayla -> Keith -> Jean -> Michelle -> Henry`\n    *   Chain 2: `Gloria -> Ryan -> Rachel -> Henry`\n\n*   This is interesting. Kayla and Gloria are both ancestors of Henry. This means they share a common descendant (Henry).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the target relationship**\n\nThe question is: What is the lineage relationship between **Gloria** and **Kayla**?\n\nLet's look at our chains:\n*   `Kayla -> ... -> Henry`\n*   `Gloria -> ... -> Henry`\n\nFrom this, we know that both Kayla and Gloria are ancestors of Henry. Therefore, Henry is a common descendant of Kayla and Gloria.\n\nLet's check the options for the relationship between Gloria and Kayla.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the options**\n\n1.  **Gloria and Kayla share a common ancestor.**\n    *   Is there anyone we can identify as an ancestor to both Gloria and Kayla? No. The information given doesn't allow us to trace either lineage back further. We can't say this is true.\n\n2.  **Gloria and Kayla share a common descendant.**\n    *   We found that Henry is a descendant of both Kayla (`Kayla -> ... -> Henry`) and Gloria (`Gloria -> ... -> Henry`).\n    *   So, yes, they share a common descendant (Henry). This looks like the correct answer.\n\n3.  **Gloria is Kayla's ancestor.**\n    *   This would mean `Gloria -> ... -> Kayla`. Our chains show no such link. They are separate branches leading to a common descendant. So, this is false.\n\n4.  **Gloria is Kayla's descendant.**\n    *   This would mean `Kayla -> ... -> Gloria`. Our chains show no such link. This is false.\n\n5.  **None of the above is correct.**\n    *   Since option 2 appears to be correct, this option is false.\n\n**Step 5: Final check and conclusion**\n\nLet's re-verify the logic.\n*   Chain 1: Kayla -> Keith -> Jean -> Michelle -> Henry\n*   Chain 2: Gloria -> Ryan -> Rachel -> Henry\n\nBoth chains end at Henry.\nThis means Henry is a descendant of Kayla.\nThis means Henry is a descendant of Gloria.\nTherefore, Henry is a common descendant of Kayla and Gloria.\n\nThe question asks for the relationship between Gloria and Kayla.\nOption 2 states: \"Gloria and Kayla share a common descendant.\"\nThis is a fact we have established based on the given information.\n\nThe other options:\n1. Common Ancestor: No information supports this.\n3. Gloria is Kayla's ancestor: No information supports this.\n4. Gloria is Kayla's descendant: No information supports this.\n\nSo, option 2 is the only statement that is verifiably true based on the premises.\n\nThe structure is like this:\n```\n      Kayla            Gloria\n         |              |\n         v              v\n       Keith            Ryan\n         |              |\n         v              v\n        Jean           Rachel\n         |              |\n         v              v\n      Michelle          |\n         |              |\n         v              v\n         <----- Henry ----->\n```\nThis visual representation confirms that Kayla and Gloria are on two separate branches that converge at their common descendant, Henry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 2.
