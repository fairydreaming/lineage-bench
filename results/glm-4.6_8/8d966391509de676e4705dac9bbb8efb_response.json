Connect Michelle to others:\n    *   Bradley is Michelle's descendant. This means **Michelle is Bradley's ancestor**.\n    *   Combining this with the first step, we get the chain: **Emma -> Michelle -> Bradley**.\n\n3.  Connect Bradley to others:\n    *   Philip is Bradley's descendant. This means **Bradley is Philip's ancestor**.\n    *   The chain is now: **Emma -> Michelle -> Bradley -> Philip**.\n\n4.  Connect Philip to others:\n    *   Steven is Philip's descendant. This means **Philip is Steven's ancestor**.\n    *   The chain is now: **Emma -> Michelle -> Bradley -> Philip -> Steven**.\n\n5.

Ann is Emma's ancestor. This is the opposite of what we found.\n3.  Ann and Emma share a common descendant.

So, for example, Ann herself is a common descendant of Ann and Emma. This statement is technically true. However, option 1 is a more specific and direct description of their relationship. In these types of logic puzzles, the most specific and direct answer is usually the intended one. The relationship \"A is the descendant of B\" is a more specific type of \"A and B share a common descendant\".\n\nOption 4: \"Ann and Emma share a common ancestor\". For this to be true, there must be some person 'Y' such that Y -> ... -> Ann and Y -> ... -> Emma. Since Emma is an ancestor of Ann, Emma is a common ancestor of Emma and Ann. This is also technically true.
