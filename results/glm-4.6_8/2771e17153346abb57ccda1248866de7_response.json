So, Christine is a descendant of Karen.\n        *   Yes, **Christine** is a common descendant of both Andrea and Karen. This statement appears to be correct.\n\n    *   **3. Andrea is Karen's descendant.**\n        *   This would mean `Karen -> Andrea`.\n        *   My chains don't show this. In fact, they are separate branches leading down to Christine.

This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **5. None of the above is correct.**\n        *   Since option 2 seems to be definitively correct based on the logic, this option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    *   Andrea -> Terry -> Samuel -> Beverly -> Sandra -> Christine\n    *   Karen -> Alice -> Christine\n    *   Both Andrea and Karen are ancestors of Christine.\n    *   Therefore, Christine is a common descendant of Andrea and Karen.\n    *   This directly supports option 2.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Answer:** The correct answer is 2.
