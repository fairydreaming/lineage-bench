So, Julia is an ancestor of Danielle.\n\nSince both Kimberly and Julia are ancestors of Danielle, Danielle is a common descendant of both Kimberly and Julia.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Kimberly and Julia share a common descendant\" is true.\n\nLet's review the options again.\n1.  Kimberly and Julia share a common descendant. (Correct, this descendant is Danielle).\n2.  Kimberly and Julia share a common ancestor. (Cannot be determined from the given information).\n3.

None of the above is correct. (Incorrect, as 1 is correct).\n\nThe logic seems solid. The two separate lines of ancestry converge at Danielle.\nLine K: Kimberly -> Dylan -> Sarah -> Frances -> Danielle\nLine J: Julia -> Madison -> Helen -> Danielle\n\nThe two lines converge on Danielle. This makes Danielle the common descendant.\nThe problem is straightforward once the chains are built correctly.\n\nLet's write down the final argument step-by-step.\n1.  **Trace Kimberly's lineage forward:**\n    *   Kimberly is Dylan's ancestor (given).\n    *   Dylan is Sarah's ancestor (given).\n    *   Sarah is Frances's ancestor (given).\n    *   Frances is Danielle's ancestor (because Danielle is Frances's descendant, given).\n    *   Therefore, **Kimberly is an ancestor of Danielle**.\n\n2.  **Trace Julia's lineage forward:**\n    *   Julia is Madison's ancestor (given).\n    *   Madison is Helen's ancestor (because Helen is Madison's descendant, given).\n    *   Helen is Danielle's ancestor (given).\n    *   Therefore, **Julia is an ancestor of Danielle**.\n\n3.  **Combine the findings:**\n    *   Since Kimberly is an ancestor of Danielle, and Julia is also an ancestor of Danielle, Danielle is a descendant of both Kimberly and Julia.\n    *   This means Danielle is a **common descendant** of Kimberly and Julia.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   1.

Kimberly and Julia share a common ancestor. - There is no information in the provided statements to support this.\n    *   3. Kimberly is Julia's ancestor. - There is no information to support this.
