This gives us: **Doris → Maria → Bradley**.\n        *   We also know William → Doris. We can add this to the front of the chain: **William → Doris → Maria → Bradley**.\n\n    *   **Chain for Eugene:**\n        *   We have Eugene → Alexis and Alexis → Heather. This gives us: **Eugene → Alexis → Heather**.\n        *   We also know Heather → Frances. We can add this to the end of the chain: **Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances**.\n\n3.  **Connect the two main chains:**\n    *   The end of Eugene's chain is Frances.\n    *   The start of Bradley's chain is William.\n    *   The statement \"Frances is William's ancestor\" provides the link: **Frances → William**.\n\n4.  **Build the complete lineage:**\n    *   Start with Eugene's chain: `Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances`\n    *   Add the link: `Frances → William`\n    *   Add Bradley's chain: `William → Doris → Maria → Bradley`\n\n    Combining these gives the full path:\n    **Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley**\n\n5.  **Determine the relationship:**\n    *   The full path shows that Eugene is at the beginning of the lineage and Bradley is at the end.\n    *   Therefore, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley.\n\n6.  **Select the correct answer:**\n    *   1.
