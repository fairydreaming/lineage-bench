Gary and Julie share a common ancestor. (Correct, Donna is their common ancestor)\n3.  Gary and Julie share a common descendant.

No. Their paths diverge at Donna. Gary is on a different branch.\n    *   Is Gary Julie's descendant? No. Same reason.\n    *   Do they share a common descendant? Let's see. Gary's descendants are unknown. Julie's descendants are unknown. The paths go *down* to Gary and Julie from Donna, not *up* from them to a common descendant. So, no.\n    *   Do they share a common ancestor? Yes. As identified in step 3, Donna is a common ancestor. Jonathan is also an ancestor of Gary and Donna is an ancestor of Jonathan, so Jonathan is *not* an ancestor of Julie. Teresa is an ancestor of Julie and Donna is an ancestor of Teresa, so Teresa is *not* an ancestor of Gary. Donna is the most recent common ancestor. But the question is just \"do they share a *common* ancestor?\", not \"who is the most recent common ancestor?\". The answer to that is \"Yes, they do.\" Donna is that ancestor.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    1.  `Gary is Julie's ancestor.` - Incorrect. They are on different branches of the family tree stemming from Donna.\n    2.  `Gary and Julie share a common ancestor.` - Correct. Donna is their common ancestor.\n    3.  `Gary and Julie share a common descendant.` - Incorrect. There's no information provided about any descendants of Gary or Julie that they share.\n    4.  `Gary is Julie's descendant.` - Incorrect. This is the reverse of option 1 and also false.\n    5.  `None of the above is correct.` - Incorrect, because option 2 is correct.\n\n6.  **Final Confirmation:** Let's re-read the logic.\n    *   `Donna -> Teresa -> Emma -> Debra -> Julie`\n    *   `Donna -> Jonathan -> Kimberly -> Gary`\n    *   Both paths start at Donna. Therefore, Donna is the ancestor of both Gary and Julie. This means Gary and Julie share a common ancestor.
