List the given relationships:**\n\n*   Joshua is Sandra's descendant. (Sandra -> ... -> Joshua)\n*   Sandra is Katherine's descendant. (Katherine -> ... -> Sandra)\n*   Ronald is Katherine's ancestor. (Ronald -> ... -> Katherine)\n*   Walter is Joshua's descendant. (Joshua -> ... -> Walter)\n*   Ronald is Matthew's ancestor.

Build the family trees based on these relationships.**\n\nLet's trace the lines upwards (ancestors) and downwards (descendants).\n\n**Line 1: Donna's Line**\n*   Walter is Donna's ancestor. (Walter -> ... -> Donna)\n*   Walter is Joshua's descendant. (Joshua -> ... -> Walter)\n*   Joshua is Sandra's descendant. (Sandra -> ... -> Joshua)\n*   Sandra is Katherine's descendant. (Katherine -> ... -> Sandra)\n\nCombining these, we get a single, continuous line:\n**Ronald -> ... -> Katherine -> ... -> Sandra -> ... -> Joshua -> ... -> Walter -> ... -> Donna**\n\nLet's verify this line with all the relevant statements.\n*   Joshua is Sandra's descendant. (Correct, Sandra is before Joshua)\n*   Sandra is Katherine's descendant. (Correct, Katherine is before Sandra)\n*   Walter is Joshua's descendant. (Correct, Joshua is before Walter)\n*   Walter is Donna's ancestor. (Correct, Walter is before Donna)\n*   Ronald is Katherine's ancestor. (Correct, Ronald is before Katherine)\nThis line seems solid. So we have a clear lineage from Ronald, through Katherine, Sandra, Joshua, and Walter, down to Donna.\n\n**Line 2: Cheryl's Line**\n*   Cheryl is Matthew's descendant. (Matthew -> ... -> Cheryl)\n*   Ronald is Matthew's ancestor. (Ronald -> ... -> Matthew)\n\nCombining these, we get another continuous line:\n**Ronald -> ... -> Matthew -> ... -> Cheryl**\n\n**3. Compare the two lines to find the relationship between Donna and Cheryl.**\n\n*   Donna's Line: **Ronald -> ... -> Katherine -> ... -> Sandra -> ... -> Joshua -> ... -> Walter -> ... -> Donna**\n*   Cheryl's Line: **Ronald -> ... -> Matthew -> ... -> Cheryl**\n\nBoth lines start with **Ronald**. This means Ronald is an ancestor to both Donna and Cheryl.\n\nTherefore, Donna and Cheryl share a common ancestor, which is Ronald.\n\n**4. Evaluate the given options:**\n\n1.  **Donna and Cheryl share a common descendant.** This is not supported by the information. We don't know of anyone who is a descendant of both Donna and Cheryl.\n2.  **Donna and Cheryl share a common ancestor.** This is correct. Ronald is a common ancestor to both.\n3.  **Donna is Cheryl's descendant.** This is incorrect. They are on different branches stemming from Ronald. We don't know the relationship between Matthew and Katherine/Sandra/Joshua. They could be siblings, cousins, or one could be the ancestor of the other. For example, if Matthew was Katherine's brother, then Donna and Cheryl would be cousins. If Matthew was Katherine's son, then Donna would be Matthew's niece's (or something similar) descendant. But the key point is we can't establish a direct descendant/ancestor relationship between Donna and Cheryl themselves. They are on two separate lines from Ronald.\n4.  **Donna is Cheryl's ancestor.** This is also incorrect for the same reason as above. They are on separate branches.\n5.  **None of the above is correct.** This is incorrect because option 2 is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:** The correct relationship is that Donna and Cheryl share a common ancestor. The common ancestor is Ronald.\n\n**Final check:**\n*   Donna's path to common ancestor: Donna <- Walter <- Joshua <- Sandra <- Katherine <- Ronald.\n*   Cheryl's path to common ancestor: Cheryl <- Matthew <- Ronald.\nBoth paths lead back to Ronald.
