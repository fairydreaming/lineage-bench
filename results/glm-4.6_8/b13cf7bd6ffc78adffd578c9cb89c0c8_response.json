Deconstruct the given information into individual statements:**\n\n*   **Statement 1:** Joshua is Sandra's descendant.  (Sandra -> ... -> Joshua)\n*   **Statement 2:** Sandra is Katherine's descendant. (Katherine -> ... -> Sandra)\n*   **Statement 3:** Ronald is Katherine's ancestor. (Ronald -> ... -> Katherine)\n*   **Statement 4:** Walter is Joshua's descendant. (Joshua -> ... -> Walter)\n*   **Statement 5:** Ronald is Matthew's ancestor. (Ronald -> ... -> Matthew)\n*   **Statement 6:** Walter is Donna's ancestor. (Walter -> ... -> Donna)\n*   **Statement 7:** Cheryl is Matthew's descendant. (Matthew -> ... -> Cheryl)\n\n**2. Chain the relationships to build family trees/lineages:**\n\n*   **Lineage 1 (Donna's line):**\n    *   From S6: Walter is Donna's ancestor. So, `Walter -> ... -> Donna`\n    *   From S4: Walter is Joshua's descendant. So, `Joshua -> ... -> Walter`. Combine this with the previous step: `Joshua -> ... -> Walter -> ... -> Donna`\n    *   From S1: Joshua is Sandra's descendant. So, `Sandra -> ... -> Joshua`. Combine: `Sandra -> ... -> Joshua -> ... -> Walter -> ... -> Donna`\n    *   From S2: Sandra is Katherine's descendant. So, `Katherine -> ... -> Sandra`. Combine: `Katherine -> ... -> Sandra -> ... -> Joshua -> ... -> Walter -> ... -> Donna`\n    *   So, the full lineage for Donna is: `Katherine -> ... -> Sandra -> ... -> Joshua -> ... -> Walter -> ... -> Donna`. This means Katherine is Donna's ancestor.\n\n*   **Lineage 2 (Cheryl's line):**\n    *   From S7: Cheryl is Matthew's descendant. So, `Matthew -> ... -> Cheryl`\n    *   From S5: Ronald is Matthew's ancestor. So, `Ronald -> ... -> Matthew`. Combine: `Ronald -> ... -> Matthew -> ... -> Cheryl`\n    *   So, the full lineage for Cheryl is: `Ronald -> ... -> Matthew -> ... -> Cheryl`. This means Ronald is Cheryl's ancestor.\n\n**3. Find the connection between the two lineages:**\n\nWe've established:\n*   Donna's line includes Katherine (as an ancestor).\n*   Cheryl's line includes Ronald (as an ancestor).\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining statement, S3:\n*   **Statement 3:** Ronald is Katherine's ancestor. So, `Ronald -> ... -> Katherine`.\n\nLet's integrate this connection into our two lineages.\n\n*   **Integrated Lineage 1 (Donna's complete line):**\n    *   We know Ronald is an ancestor of Katherine (`Ronald -> ... -> Katherine`).\n    *   We know Katherine is an ancestor of Donna (`Katherine -> ... -> Sandra -> ... -> Joshua -> ... -> Walter -> ... -> Donna`).\n    *   Therefore, Ronald is also an ancestor of Donna. The full chain is: `Ronald -> ... -> Katherine -> ... -> Sandra -> ... -> Joshua -> ... -> Walter -> ... -> Donna`.\n\n*   **Integrated Lineage 2 (Cheryl's line):**\n    *   We know Ronald is an ancestor of Cheryl. The chain is: `Ronald -> ... -> Matthew -> ... -> Cheryl`.\n\n**4. Analyze the relationship between Donna and Cheryl:**\n\nBoth Donna and Cheryl have Ronald as a direct ancestor.\n\n*   Lineage of Donna: `Ronald -> ... -> Katherine -> ... -> Donna`\n*   Lineage of Cheryl: `Ronald -> ... -> Matthew -> ... -> Cheryl`\n\nSince they both share a common ancestor (Ronald), they are related. They are, in genealogical terms, cousins of some degree, or more broadly, they share a common ancestor.\n\n**5. Evaluate the options:**\n\n*   **1. Donna and Cheryl share a common descendant.**\n    *   This would mean there is someone who is a descendant of both Donna and Cheryl. The information provided doesn't tell us about any descendants of Donna or Cheryl. We cannot confirm this. For example, we don't know if Donna has any children. So, this is not necessarily true based on the given data.\n\n*   **2. Donna and Cheryl share a common ancestor.**\n    *   As determined in step 4, Ronald is an ancestor of both Donna and Cheryl. This statement is explicitly supported by the logical deduction from the given facts.\n\n*   **3. Donna is Cheryl's descendant.**\n    *   This would mean Cheryl is Donna's ancestor. The lineages are `Ronald -> ... -> Donna` and `Ronald -> ... -> Cheryl`. One does not descend from the other. They are on separate branches stemming from the common ancestor Ronald. So, this is false.\n\n*   **4. Donna is Cheryl's ancestor.**\n    *   This would mean Cheryl is Donna's descendant. As above, they are on separate branches. This is false.\n\n*   **5. None of the above is correct.**\n    *   Since option 2 is correct, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that can be definitively proven from the given information is that Donna and Cheryl share a common ancestor (Ronald). Therefore, the correct answer is option 2.Let's double-check the logic.\nRonald -> Katherine -> Sandra -> Joshua -> Walter -> Donna. (Chain: S3, S2, S1, S4, S6)\nRonald -> Matthew -> Cheryl. (Chain: S5, S7)\n\nYes, the logic holds. Ronald is the common ancestor. So option 2 is correct.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\n1.  Trace Donna's lineage back: Walter -> Joshua -> Sandra -> Katherine. So Katherine is Donna's ancestor.\n2.  Trace Cheryl's lineage back: Matthew. So Matthew is Cheryl's ancestor.\n3.  Trace those ancestors back:\n    *   Ronald is Matthew's ancestor. So Ronald is Cheryl's ancestor.\n    *   Ronald is Katherine's ancestor. Since Katherine is Donna's ancestor, Ronald must also be Donna's ancestor.\n4.  Conclusion: Ronald is an ancestor to both Donna and Cheryl. They share a common ancestor.\n5.  Match to options: This matches option 2.\n6.
