Let's break it down step by step:

- From 1 and 5, we can deduce that Jason is Janet's ancestor (because Jason is Michael's ancestor, and Michael is Janet's ancestor).
- From 4 and 6, we can deduce that Dorothy is Theresa's ancestor (because Dorothy is Jason's ancestor, and Theresa is Andrea's descendant, but this doesn't directly affect the relationship between Frances and Janet).
- From 2 and 3, we know that Andrea is a descendant of Frances and Nicholas is a descendant of Frances and an ancestor of Andrea.

Now, let's focus on the connection between Frances and Janet:

- We know that Andrea is a descendant of Nicholas, who is a descendant of Frances.
- We also know that Theresa is an ancestor of Andrea.
- However, there is no direct connection established between Frances and Janet through the given relationships.

The relationships provided do not explicitly state a direct ancestral or descendant relationship between Frances and Janet, nor do they imply a common ancestor or descendant shared by both.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

5. Susan is Kelly's descendant.
6. Andrea is Kelly's ancestor.
7. Susan is Janet's ancestor.

From these relationships, we can deduce:
- Kayla is Janet's descendant, and Susan is Janet's ancestor, so Kayla must be Susan's descendant.
- Kayla is Adam's ancestor, so Susan (who is Kayla's descendant) must also be Adam's descendant.
- Andrea is Kelly's ancestor, and Susan is Kelly's descendant, so Susan must be Andrea's descendant.
- Andrea is Joseph's descendant, so Joseph must be Andrea's ancestor.

Now, we know that:
- Cheryl is Adam's descendant.
- Susan is Adam's descendant (via Kayla).
- Susan is Joseph's ancestor (via Andrea).

This means Cheryl and Joseph are both descendants of Adam, but Joseph is a descendant of Susan, who is a descendant of Adam, while Cheryl is directly a descendant of Adam.

Therefore, Cheryl and Joseph share a common ancestor (Adam).

- **Philip is Logan's descendant**, so Logan is Philip's ancestor.
- **Michael is Philip's descendant**, so Philip is Michael's ancestor.

Thus, Logan is an ancestor of Michael through Philip.

Now, we have:
- Randy is a descendant of Logan through Julie, George, and Christine.
- Michael is a descendant of Logan through Philip.

This means Randy and Michael share a common ancestor, which is Logan.

1) First, let's organize the given relationships:
   * Katherine → Arthur (Katherine is Arthur's ancestor)
   * Bobby → Shirley (Bobby is Shirley's ancestor)
   * Randy → Judith (Randy is Judith's ancestor)
   * Jean → Bobby (Bobby is Jean's descendant)
   * Edward → Jean (Edward is Jean's ancestor)
   * Shirley → Katherine (Katherine is Shirley's descendant)
   * Arthur → Judith (Arthur is Judith's ancestor)

2) From these relationships, we can deduce:
   * Since Arthur is Judith's ancestor, and Katherine is Arthur's ancestor, Katherine is also Judith's ancestor
   * Since Bobby is Jean's descendant, and Bobby is Shirley's ancestor, Shirley is Jean's ancestor
   * Since Shirley is Jean's ancestor, and Katherine is Shirley's descendant, Katherine is Jean's ancestor

3) Now we know:
   * Katherine is Jean's ancestor
   * Edward is Jean's ancestor

4) However, we don't have enough information to determine the direct relationship between Randy and Edward. While we know they are both ancestors of Judith (through different paths), we cannot determine if they are directly related to each other.

5) Looking at the options:
   * We can't say they share a common descendant
