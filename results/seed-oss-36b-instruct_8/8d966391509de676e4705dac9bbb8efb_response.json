First, I need to map out all the lineage relationships given and see if we can connect Ann and Emma. Let's list out each statement again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. Steven is Philip's descendant. So that means Philip is an ancestor of Steven, right? Because a descendant is someone who comes after in lineage, so if A is B's descendant, then B is A's ancestor. So Steven ← Philip (ancestor/descendant, with arrow pointing from descendant to ancestor maybe? Or maybe better to write as \"X is Y's ancestor\" means Y is X's descendant, so Y ← X (Y is a descendant of X, so X is above Y in the family tree).\n\n2. Julie is Sarah's ancestor. So Sarah is Julie's descendant: Sarah ← Julie.\n\n3. Michelle is Emma's descendant. So Emma is Michelle's ancestor: Michelle ← Emma.\n\n4. Bradley is Michelle's descendant. So Michelle is Bradley's ancestor: Bradley ← Michelle. From point 3, Michelle ← Emma, so Bradley ← Michelle ← Emma, so Bradley is also Emma's descendant (since descendant can be through multiple generations: if A is B's descendant and B is C's descendant, then A is C's descendant). So Bradley ← Emma as well, maybe? Let's note that: Emma is ancestor of Michelle, who is ancestor of Bradley, so Emma → Michelle → Bradley (ancestor to descendant, so arrow from ancestor to descendant might be clearer: Emma → Michelle → Bradley, meaning Emma is ancestor of Michelle, Michelle is ancestor of Bradley, so Emma is ancestor of Bradley).\n\n5. Sarah is Ann's ancestor. So Ann is Sarah's descendant: Ann ← Sarah (or Sarah → Ann).\n\n6. Philip is Bradley's descendant. So Bradley is Philip's ancestor: Philip ← Bradley. From point 4, we had Bradley ← Michelle ← Emma, so Philip ← Bradley ← Michelle ← Emma, so Philip is a descendant of Emma too? Because Emma is ancestor of Bradley, who is ancestor of Philip, so Emma → Bradley → Philip.\n\n7. Steven is Julie's ancestor. So Julie is Steven's descendant: Julie ← Steven (or Steven → Julie). From point 2, Julie is Sarah's ancestor, so Sarah ← Julie ← Steven, so Steven → Julie → Sarah. Then from point 5, Sarah is Ann's ancestor, so Sarah → Ann. So putting that together: Steven → Julie → Sarah → Ann. So Ann is a descendant of Steven, Julie, Sarah, right? Because each arrow is ancestor to descendant, so Steven is ancestor of Julie, Julie of Sarah, Sarah of Ann, so Ann is descendant of all three.\n\nNow let's recap the other chain: From point 6, Philip is Bradley's descendant, so Bradley → Philip. From point 1, Steven is Philip's descendant, so Philip → Steven. Oh, that's a key link! So Philip → Steven. Because Steven is Philip's descendant, so Philip is Steven's ancestor, so Philip → Steven. Wait, let's confirm: \"Steven is Philip's descendant\" – yes, that means Philip is an ancestor of Steven, so the line is Philip (ancestor) → ... → Steven (descendant). So that connects the two chains we had before.\n\nLet's list that connection: We had from point 7: Steven → Julie → Sarah → Ann. And from point 1: Philip → Steven (since Steven is Philip's descendant). Then point 6: Bradley → Philip (since Philip is Bradley's descendant). Point 4: Michelle → Bradley (Bradley is Michelle's descendant). Point 3: Emma → Michelle (Michelle is Emma's descendant). So let's string all those ancestor→descendant arrows together starting from Emma:\n\nEmma → Michelle (from 3: Michelle is Emma's descendant, so Emma is ancestor of Michelle)\nMichelle → Bradley (from 4: Bradley is Michelle's descendant, so Michelle is ancestor of Bradley)\nBradley → Philip (from 6: Philip is Bradley's descendant, so Bradley is ancestor of Philip)\nPhilip → Steven (from 1: Steven is Philip's descendant, so Philip is ancestor of Steven)\nSteven → Julie (from 7: Julie is Steven's ancestor? Wait no: point 7 says \"Steven is Julie's ancestor\" – so Steven is ancestor of Julie, which means Julie is Steven's descendant, so Steven → Julie. Correct.\nJulie → Sarah (from 2: Julie is Sarah's ancestor, so Sarah is Julie's descendant, Julie → Sarah)\nSarah → Ann (from 5: Sarah is Ann's ancestor, so Ann is Sarah's descendant, Sarah → Ann)\n\nOh! So if we connect all those, it's Emma → Michelle → Bradley → Philip → Steven → Julie → Sarah → Ann. That's a straight line from Emma all the way down to Ann. Let's check each step to make sure I didn't mix up ancestor/descendant:\n\n- Emma to Michelle: Michelle is Emma's descendant (given), so Emma is ancestor of Michelle: correct, arrow Emma→Michelle.\n- Michelle to Bradley: Bradley is Michelle's descendant (given), so Michelle→Bradley: correct.\n- Bradley to Philip: Philip is Bradley's descendant (given), so Bradley→Philip: correct.\n- Philip to Steven: Steven is Philip's descendant (given), so Philip→Steven: correct.\n- Steven to Julie: Steven is Julie's ancestor (given), so Steven→Julie: correct (because if X is Y's ancestor, Y is X's descendant, so X→Y).\n- Julie to Sarah: Julie is Sarah's ancestor (given), so Julie→Sarah: correct.\n- Sarah to Ann: Sarah is Ann's ancestor (given), so Sarah→Ann: correct.\n\nSo putting that all together, Ann is a descendant of Emma? Wait, because each step is ancestor to descendant, so Emma is an ancestor of Michelle, who is ancestor of Bradley, etc., all the way down to Ann. So Ann is a descendant of Emma. Let's check the options: option 1 is \"Ann is Emma's descendant.\" Is that right?\n\nWait let's make sure we didn't mix up any direction. Let's take \"Steven is Philip's descendant\" – so Philip is an ancestor of Steven. So if you draw a family tree, Philip is above Steven. Then \"Philip is Bradley's descendant\" – so Bradley is above Philip. \"Bradley is Michelle's descendant\" – Michelle above Bradley. \"Michelle is Emma's descendant\" – Emma above Michelle. So Emma is above Michelle, who is above Bradley, above Philip, above Steven. Then \"Steven is Julie's ancestor\" – so Steven is above Julie. \"Julie is Sarah's ancestor\" – Julie above Sarah. \"Sarah is Ann's ancestor\" – Sarah above Ann. So the tree from top (ancestor) to bottom (descendant) is: Emma → Michelle → Bradley → Philip → Steven → Julie → Sarah → Ann. So Ann is at the bottom, Emma at the top. Therefore, Ann is a descendant of Emma, which is option 1.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in the Steven and Julie direction? Let's recheck point 7: \"Steven is Julie's ancestor.\" Yes, ancestor means older generation, so Steven is above Julie, so Julie is Steven's descendant. Correct. Then Julie is Sarah's ancestor (point 2), so Sarah is below Julie. Sarah is Ann's ancestor (point 5), so Ann is below Sarah. So that chain is Steven → Julie → Sarah → Ann. Then Philip is above Steven (since Steven is Philip's descendant), Bradley above Philip, Michelle above Bradley, Emma above Michelle. So Emma is the top ancestor in that line, and Ann is the bottom descendant. So Ann is Emma's descendant.
