First, I need to list out all the given relationships and see if we can connect Eugene and Bradley through a family tree. Let's start by writing down each relationship as \"X is ancestor of Y\" which means Y is a descendant of X, so we can draw lines like X → ... → Y (ancestor to descendant).\n\nFirst, let's list all the ancestor-descendant pairs:\n\n1. Doris → Maria (Doris is Maria's ancestor)\n2. Maria → Bradley (Bradley is Maria's descendant, so reverse: Bradley is descendant of Maria, so Maria → Bradley)\n3. Alexis → Heather (Alexis is Heather's ancestor)\n4. William → Doris (Doris is William's descendant, so William → Doris)\n5. Heather → Frances (Frances is Heather's descendant, so Heather → Frances)\n6. Eugene → Alexis (Alexis is Eugene's descendant, so Eugene → Alexis)\n7. Frances → William (Frances is William's ancestor, so Frances → William)\n\nNow let's try to chain these together. Let's start with Eugene first because we need Eugene and Bradley. From point 6: Eugene → Alexis. Then point 3: Alexis → Heather, so Eugene → Alexis → Heather. Then point 5: Heather → Frances, so Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances. Then point 7: Frances → William, so now Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William. Then point 4: William → Doris, so Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris. Then point 1: Doris → Maria, so Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria. Then point 2: Maria → Bradley, so putting it all together: Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley. \n\nWait, does that make sense? Let's check each step again to make sure I didn't mix up ancestor and descendant. Ancestor means \"comes before in lineage,\" so if X is Y's ancestor, X is an older generation than Y, so the line goes from ancestor (older) to descendant (younger): X (ancestor) → Y (descendant). So:\n\n- Alexis is Eugene's descendant: so Eugene is Alexis's ancestor, so Eugene → Alexis (correct, that's what I did)\n- Alexis is Heather's ancestor: Alexis → Heather, so Eugene → Alexis → Heather (good)\n- Frances is Heather's descendant: Heather → Frances, so now Eugene → ... → Frances\n- Frances is William's ancestor: Frances → William, so Eugene → ... → Frances → William\n- Doris is William's descendant: William → Doris, so Eugene → ... → William → Doris\n- Doris is Maria's ancestor: Doris → Maria, so Eugene → ... → Doris → Maria\n- Bradley is Maria's descendant: Maria → Bradley, so Eugene → ... → Maria → Bradley\n\nOh! So that's a straight line from Eugene all the way down to Bradley. So Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley? Wait, let me confirm each link again to be sure I didn't reverse any.\n\nGiven: \"Frances is William's ancestor\" – so Frances is an ancestor of William, meaning William is a descendant of Frances, so Frances → William (correct). \"Doris is William's descendant\" – William → Doris (correct). \"Doris is Maria's ancestor\" – Doris → Maria (correct). \"Bradley is Maria's descendant\" – Maria → Bradley (correct). So William → Doris → Maria → Bradley: that's William is ancestor of Bradley, Doris too, Maria too.\n\nThen Frances → William, so Frances is ancestor of William, hence also ancestor of Bradley. Heather → Frances (since Frances is Heather's descendant), so Heather → Frances → William → ... → Bradley, so Heather is ancestor of Bradley. Alexis → Heather (Alexis is Heather's ancestor), so Alexis → Heather → ... → Bradley, Alexis is ancestor of Bradley. Eugene → Alexis (Alexis is Eugene's descendant, so Eugene is Alexis's ancestor), so Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley. Therefore, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley. So the first option: \"Eugene is Bradley's ancestor.\" Is that right?\n\nWait, did I mix up any \"ancestor\" and \"descendant\"? Let's take \"Alexis is Eugene's descendant\" – that means Eugene is Alexis's ancestor, yes. Because if A is B's descendant, B is A's ancestor. So that's correct. So Eugene is Alexis's ancestor, Alexis is Heather's ancestor, so Eugene is Heather's ancestor. Heather is Frances's ancestor (since Frances is Heather's descendant), so Eugene is Frances's ancestor. Frances is William's ancestor, so Eugene is William's ancestor. William is Doris's ancestor, Doris is Maria's ancestor, Maria is Bradley's ancestor. Therefore, Eugene is Bradley's ancestor.
