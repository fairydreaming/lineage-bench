descendant)\n\nSo, from Roy, we have a long line to Brittany.\n\nSpecifically, Roy is an ancestor of Bobby, who is an ancestor of Harold, and so on, all the way down to Brittany.\n\nIn terms of lineage, Roy is an ancestor of Brittany because there is a direct line of descent.\n\nLet me confirm the direction.\n\nFrom Roy to Bobby: Bobby is descendant of Roy, so Roy is ancestor.\n\nThen Bobby to Harold: Harold is descendant of Bobby, so Bobby is ancestor, thus Roy is ancestor of Harold.\n\nSimilarly, all the way to Brittany.\n\nIn the chain, it's a sequence of descendants.\n\nRoy -> Bobby -> Harold -> Eugene -> Elizabeth -> Albert -> Janice -> Joyce -> Anthony -> Evelyn -> Megan -> Juan -> Steven -> Alan -> Timothy -> Helen -> Diana -> Philip -> Alexis -> Christian -> Martha -> Victoria -> Scott -> Marilyn -> Kenneth -> Heather -> Madison -> Larry -> Wayne -> Billy -> Jacqueline -> Mary -> Eric -> Julie -> Kevin -> Teresa -> Debra -> Russell -> Denise -> Nicholas -> Brenda -> George -> Sarah -> Amy -> Mason -> David -> Ruth -> Hannah -> Raymond -> Nathan -> Willie -> Stephanie -> Jerry -> Douglas -> Stephen -> Brandon -> Joshua -> Lawrence -> Ronald -> Cynthia -> Nicole -> Christina -> Christopher -> Brittany.\n\nThat's a long chain, but it seems connected.\n\nNow, is Roy an ancestor of Brittany? Based on this, yes.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no contradictions.\n\nFor example, Brittany is Christopher's descendant, and Christopher is from Christina, etc., and we have a path from Roy to that line.\n\nAlso, in the chain, we have points like Anthony to Evelyn, etc.\n\nAnother thing: we have Brenda in the chain, and Brenda is George's ancestor, but also Brenda is Nicholas's descendant, which is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, all seem fine.\n\nBut the question is about Roy and Brittany specifically.\n\nOption 1 is \"Roy is Brittany's ancestor.\"\n\nBased on this chain, it seems so.\n\nBut let me see if there is any information that might contradict this or show they share a common ancestor instead.\n\nIs there any loop or something?\n\nFor example, let's see if Brittany is also connected to Roy in another way.\n\nBut from the chain, it seems direct.\n\nPerhaps I can see if they have a common descendant or something, but option 4 is share common descendant, which might not be the case if one is ancestor.\n\nSince Roy is ancestor, they don't share a common ancestor in the sense that Roy is the ancestor, so Brittany is descendant, not that they share someone else.\n\nBut technically, Roy is an ancestor, and Brittany has Roy as ancestor, so they share Roy as common ancestor? No, Roy is not an ancestor to himself; sharing common ancestor usually means they have a common person further up.\n\nBut in this case, since Roy is direct ancestor, it's not \"share\" in that sense; it's direct line.\n\nOption 2 is \"Roy and Brittany share a common ancestor,\" which would be true if they have some common person, but since Roy is ancestor, it might be trivially true, but I think the intent is to see if it's direct or through another.\n\nBut let's look at the options.\n\nOption 1: Roy is Brittany's ancestor.\n\nOption 2: Share common ancestor.\n\nIf Roy is ancestor, then they do share a common ancestor, which is Roy, but typically \"share common ancestor\" implies a third person.\n\nIn lineage terms, if A is ancestor of B, then B has A as ancestor, so they share A as common ancestor only if we consider A as the shared one, but it might be redundant.\n\nHowever, in multiple choice, probably option 1 is more precise.\n\nBut let me check if there is no direct path, but they share someone else.\n\nIn this case, we have a direct path.\n\nPerhaps I can find a shorter path or something.\n\nAnother thing: in the list, there might be multiple connections.\n\nFor example, let's see if Brittany connects back to Roy through another line.\n\nBut I think the chain I have is sufficient.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the relationship in terms of the entire tree.\n\nBut I think for this purpose, since we have a path, Roy is ancestor.\n\nBut let me verify the Brittany end.\n\nBrittany is Christopher's descendant.\n\nChristopher is Christina's descendant? Christina is Christopher's ancestor, so Christopher descends from Christina.\n\nChristina is Nicole's descendant.\n\nNicole is Cynthia's descendant.\n\nCynthia is Ronald's descendant? Ronald is Cynthia's ancestor, so Cynthia descends from Ronald.\n\nRonald is Lawrence's descendant.\n\nLawrence is Joshua's descendant?

Brenda is George's ancestor, so George descends from Brenda.\n\nBrenda is Nicholas's descendant.\n\nNicholas is Denise's descendant? Denise is Nicholas's ancestor, so Nicholas descends from Denise.\n\nDenise is Russell's descendant? Russell is Denise's ancestor, so Denise descends from Russell.\n\nRussell is Debra's descendant? Debra is Russell's ancestor, so Russell descends from Debra.\n\nDebra is Teresa's descendant? Teresa is Debra's ancestor, so Debra descends from Teresa.\n\nTeresa is Kevin's descendant? Kevin is Teresa's ancestor, so Teresa descends from Kevin.\n\nKevin is Julie's descendant.\n\nJulie is Eric's descendant.\n\nEric is Mary's descendant.\n\nMary is Jacqueline's descendant.\n\nJacqueline is Billy's descendant? Billy is Jacqueline's ancestor, so Jacqueline descends from Billy.\n\nBilly is Wayne's descendant? Wayne is Billy's ancestor, so Billy descends from Wayne.\n\nWayne is Larry's descendant.\n\nLarry is Madison's descendant.\n\nMadison is Heather's descendant? Heather is Madison's ancestor, so Madison descends from Heather.\n\nHeather is Kenneth's descendant.\n\nKenneth is Marilyn's descendant? Marilyn is Kenneth's ancestor, so Kenneth descends from Marilyn.\n\nMarilyn is Scott's descendant? Scott is Marilyn's ancestor, so Marilyn descends from Scott.\n\nScott is Victoria's descendant.\n\nVictoria is Martha's descendant? Martha is Victoria's ancestor, so Victoria descends from Martha.\n\nMartha is Christian's descendant? Christian is Martha's ancestor, so Martha descends from Christian.\n\nChristian is Alexis's descendant? Alexis is Christian's ancestor, so Christian descends from Alexis.\n\nAlexis is Philip's descendant? Philip is Alexis's ancestor, so Alexis descends from Philip.\n\nPhilip is Diana's descendant.\n\nDiana is Helen's descendant.\n\nHelen is Timothy's descendant.\n\nTimothy is Alan's descendant? Alan is Timothy's ancestor, so Timothy descends from Alan.\n\nAlan is Steven's descendant? Steven is Alan's ancestor, so Alan descends from Steven.\n\nSteven is Juan's descendant.\n\nJuan is Megan's descendant? Megan is Juan's ancestor, so Juan descends from Megan.\n\nMegan is Evelyn's descendant? Evelyn is Megan's ancestor, so Megan descends from Evelyn.\n\nEvelyn is Anthony's descendant? Anthony is Evelyn's ancestor, so Evelyn descends from Anthony.\n\nAnthony is Joyce's descendant.\n\nJoyce is Janice's descendant.\n\nJanice is Albert's descendant.\n\nAlbert is Elizabeth's descendant.\n\nElizabeth is Eugene's descendant.\n\nEugene is Harold's descendant.\n\nHarold is Bobby's descendant.\n\nBobby is Roy's descendant.\n\nSo same chain.\n\nNow, back to Roy and Brittany.\n\nRoy is the start, Brittany is the end, so Roy is ancestor.\n\nBut is there any indication that they are the same person or something? No.\n\nPerhaps I need to see if Brittany is also an ancestor of Roy or something, but that would be impossible unless cycle, but lineage shouldn't have cycles.\n\nAll relationships are one-way, so no cycles.\n\nTherefore, Roy is an ancestor of Brittany.\n\nSo the answer should be option 1.\n\nBut let me see the other options.\n\nOption 2: share common ancestor. Well, Roy is an ancestor, so technically yes, but it might not be the best answer since it's direct.\n\nBut in multiple choice, option 1 is specific.\n\nOption 3: Roy is descendant, which is opposite.\n\nOption 4: share common descendant, which might be true if they have a common descendant, but since Roy is ancestor of Brittany, any descendant of Brittany is also descendant of Roy, so they share common descendants, like Brittany herself or others.\n\nBut that might be true, but option 1 is more direct.\n\nFor example, if A is ancestor of B, then A and B share common descendants, specifically B and B's descendants.\n\nBut the phrase \"share a common descendant\" might imply that there is a descendant that both have, but since A is ancestor, any descendant of B is also descendant of A, so yes.\n\nBut in context, probably option 1 is the intended.\n\nMoreover, option 2 \"share a common ancestor\" is also true, since Roy is an ancestor of both, but Roy is not an ancestor of himself; for Roy and Brittany, Roy has no ancestor in this context, I think.\n\n\"Share a common ancestor\" typically means there is a third person C such that C is ancestor of both.\n\nFor example, if A and B are siblings, they share a common ancestor parent.\n\nBut if A is direct ancestor of B, then C could be A, but A is not ancestor of A.\n\nSo strictly, if A is ancestor of B, then they do not share a common ancestor other than themselves, but it's messy.\n\nIn genealogy, when we say \"share a common ancestor,\" it usually implies a person further back that both descend from, not one being the direct ancestor.\n\nFor instance, cousins share a common grandparent, not that one is the parent.\n\nSo in this case, since Roy is the direct ancestor, option 1 should be chosen.\n\nIf they were cousins, then option 2.\n\nBut here, it's direct line.\n\nTo confirm, is there a shorter path or something?\n\nAnother thing: in the list, there is Bobby who is connected to both, but Bobby is descendant of Roy and ancestor of Harold, who is in Brittany's line.\n\nIn the chain, Bobby is part of it.\n\nBut Roy is before Bobby.\n\nPerhaps I can see if Brittany has another ancestor that connects.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nLet me see if Roy and Brittany have a common ancestor elsewhere.\n\nFor example, from the chain, the earliest is Roy, or further?\n\nIn my chain, Roy is the start, but actually, Roy might have ancestors, but no information given.\n\nSimilarly, Brittany has descendants, but not relevant.\n\nThe relationships only give partial, but in this case, we have a path from Roy to Brittany.\n\nPerhaps there is someone above Roy.\n\nBut since no information, we assume Roy is an ancestor in this context.\n\nSimilarly, for Brittany, she might be the last, but not specified.\n\nBut for the relationship between them, we can say Roy is ancestor.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's see if there is any contradiction.\n\nFor example, is there a statement that might imply otherwise?\n\nOne thing: in the list, we have \"Elizabeth is Albert's ancestor\" and \"Albert is Janice's ancestor\", etc., all consistent.\n\nAnother point: \"Joyce is Janice's descendant\" and \"Anthony is Joyce's descendant\", so Anthony descends from Joyce, who descends from Janice, etc.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the entire tree.\n\nBut I think it's solid.\n\nSo, Roy is Brittany's ancestor.\n\nTherefore, option 1.\n\nBut let me see the answer choices again.\n\nSelect the correct answer:\n\n1. Roy is Brittany's ancestor.\n\n2. Roy and Brittany share a common ancestor.\n\n3. Roy is Brittany's descendant.\n\n4. Roy and Brittany share a common descendant.\n\n5. None of the above.\n\nBased on this, 1 seems correct.\n\nPerhaps I should check if they share a common descendant.\n\nFor example, if Brittany has a child, then Roy and Brittany both have that child as descendant, since Roy is ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, any descendant of Brittany is a descendant of Roy.\n\nSo technically, they share common descendants.\n\nBut option 4 says \"share a common descendant,\" which is true, but option 1 is also true and more specific to the relationship.\n\nIn multiple choice, probably they expect the direct relationship.\n\nMoreover, if I choose option 4, it might be true but not the primary relationship.\n\nSimilarly, option 2 might be misinterpreting.\n\nBut let me see if there is no direct line.\n\nAnother thought: in the chain, I have Anthony to Evelyn, and Anthony is Evelyn's ancestor? \"Anthony is Evelyn's ancestor\" so Evelyn descends from Anthony.\n\nThen Evelyn to Megan, Evelyn is Megan's ancestor, so Megan descends from Evelyn.\n\nThen to Juan, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can find a connection without the long chain.\n\nFor example, from Roy to Bobby to Harold to Eugene to Elizabeth to Albert to Janice to Joyce to Anthony.\n\nNow Anthony is Evelyn's ancestor.\n\nEvelyn is Megan's ancestor.\n\nMegan is Juan's ancestor.\n\nJuan is Steven's ancestor? Steven is Juan's descendant, so Steven descends from Juan.\n\nSteven is Alan's ancestor.\n\nAlan is Timothy's ancestor.\n\nTimothy is Helen's ancestor?

Scott is Victoria's descendant, so Scott descends from Victoria.\n\nScott is Marilyn's ancestor.\n\nMarilyn is Kenneth's ancestor.\n\nKenneth is Heather's ancestor? Heather is Kenneth's descendant, so Heather descends from Kenneth.\n\nHeather is Madison's ancestor.\n\nMadison is Larry's ancestor? Larry is Madison's descendant, so Larry descends from Madison.\n\nLarry is Wayne's ancestor? Wayne is Larry's descendant, so Wayne descends from Larry.\n\nWayne is Billy's ancestor.\n\nBilly is Jacqueline's ancestor.\n\nJacqueline is Mary's ancestor? Mary is Jacqueline's descendant, so Mary descends from Jacqueline.\n\nMary is Eric's ancestor? Eric is Mary's descendant, so Eric descends from Mary.\n\nEric is Julie's ancestor? Julie is Eric's descendant, so Julie descends from Eric.\n\nJulie is Kevin's ancestor? Kevin is Julie's descendant, so Kevin descends from Julie.\n\nKevin is Teresa's ancestor.\n\nTeresa is Debra's ancestor.\n\nDebra is Russell's ancestor.\n\nRussell is Denise's ancestor.\n\nDenise is Nicholas's ancestor.\n\nNicholas is Brenda's ancestor?

(Christina is Nicole's descendant)\n\n- Christina has descendant Christopher (Christina is Christopher's ancestor)\n\n- Christopher has descendant Brittany (Brittany is Christopher's descendant)\n\nSo, from Roy, we have a long line to Brittany.\n\nSpecifically, Roy is an ancestor of Bobby, who is an ancestor of Harold, and so on, all the way down to Brittany.\n\nIn terms of lineage, Roy is an ancestor of Brittany because there is a direct line of descent.\n\nLet me confirm the direction.\n\nFrom Roy to Bobby: Bobby is descendant of Roy, so Roy is ancestor.\n\nThen Bobby to Harold: Harold is descendant of Bobby, so Bobby is ancestor, thus Roy is ancestor of Harold.\n\nSimilarly, all the way to Brittany.\n\nIn the chain, it's a sequence of descendants.\n\nRoy -> Bobby -> Harold -> Eugene -> Elizabeth -> Albert -> Janice -> Joyce -> Anthony -> Evelyn -> Megan -> Juan -> Steven -> Alan -> Timothy -> Helen -> Diana -> Philip -> Alexis -> Christian -> Martha -> Victoria -> Scott -> Marilyn -> Kenneth -> Heather -> Madison -> Larry -> Wayne -> Billy -> Jacqueline -> Mary -> Eric -> Julie -> Kevin -> Teresa -> Debra -> Russell -> Denise -> Nicholas -> Brenda -> George -> Sarah -> Amy -> Mason -> David -> Ruth -> Hannah -> Raymond -> Nathan -> Willie -> Stephanie -> Jerry -> Douglas -> Stephen -> Brandon -> Joshua -> Lawrence -> Ronald -> Cynthia -> Nicole -> Christina -> Christopher -> Brittany.\n\nThat's a long chain, but it seems connected.\n\nNow, is Roy an ancestor of Brittany? Based on this, yes.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no contradictions.\n\nFor example, Brittany is Christopher's descendant, and Christopher is from Christina, etc., and we have a path from Roy to that line.\n\nAlso, in the chain, we have points like Anthony to Evelyn, etc.\n\nAnother thing: we have Brenda in the chain, and Brenda is George's ancestor, but also Brenda is Nicholas's descendant, which is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, all seem fine.\n\nBut the question is about Roy and Brittany specifically.\n\nOption 1 is \"Roy is Brittany's ancestor.\"\n\nBased on this chain, it seems so.\n\nBut let me see if there is any information that might contradict this or show they share a common ancestor instead.\n\nIs there any loop or something?\n\nFor example, let's see if Brittany is also connected to Roy in another way.\n\nBut from the chain, it seems direct.\n\nPerhaps I can see if they have a common descendant or something, but option 4 is share common descendant, which might not be the case if one is ancestor.\n\nSince Roy is ancestor, they don't share a common ancestor in the sense that Roy is the ancestor, so Brittany is descendant, not that they share someone else.\n\nBut technically, Roy is an ancestor, and Brittany has Roy as ancestor, so they share Roy as common ancestor? No, Roy is not an ancestor to himself; sharing common ancestor usually means they have a common person further up.\n\nBut in this case, since Roy is direct ancestor, it's not \"share\" in that sense; it's direct line.\n\nOption 2 is \"Roy and Brittany share a common ancestor,\" which would be true if they have some common person, but since Roy is ancestor, it might be trivially true, but I think the intent is to see if it's direct or through another.\n\nBut let's look at the options.\n\nOption 1: Roy is Brittany's ancestor.\n\nOption 2: Share common ancestor.\n\nIf Roy is ancestor, then they do share a common ancestor, which is Roy, but typically \"share common ancestor\" implies a third person.\n\nIn lineage terms, if A is ancestor of B, then B has A as ancestor, so they share A as common ancestor only if we consider A as the shared one, but it might be redundant.\n\nHowever, in multiple choice, probably option 1 is more precise.\n\nBut let me check if there is no direct path, but they share someone else.\n\nIn this case, we have a direct path.\n\nPerhaps I can find a shorter path or something.\n\nAnother thing: in the list, there might be multiple connections.\n\nFor example, let's see if Brittany connects back to Roy through another line.\n\nBut I think the chain I have is sufficient.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the relationship in terms of the entire tree.\n\nBut I think for this purpose, since we have a path, Roy is ancestor.\n\nBut let me verify the Brittany end.\n\nBrittany is Christopher's descendant.\n\nChristopher is Christina's descendant?

Debra is Russell's ancestor, so Russell descends from Debra.\n\nDebra is Teresa's descendant? Teresa is Debra's ancestor, so Debra descends from Teresa.\n\nTeresa is Kevin's descendant? Kevin is Teresa's ancestor, so Teresa descends from Kevin.\n\nKevin is Julie's descendant.\n\nJulie is Eric's descendant.\n\nEric is Mary's descendant.\n\nMary is Jacqueline's descendant.\n\nJacqueline is Billy's descendant? Billy is Jacqueline's ancestor, so Jacqueline descends from Billy.\n\nBilly is Wayne's descendant? Wayne is Billy's ancestor, so Billy descends from Wayne.\n\nWayne is Larry's descendant.\n\nLarry is Madison's descendant.\n\nMadison is Heather's descendant? Heather is Madison's ancestor, so Madison descends from Heather.\n\nHeather is Kenneth's descendant.\n\nKenneth is Marilyn's descendant? Marilyn is Kenneth's ancestor, so Kenneth descends from Marilyn.\n\nMarilyn is Scott's descendant? Scott is Marilyn's ancestor, so Marilyn descends from Scott.\n\nScott is Victoria's descendant.\n\nVictoria is Martha's descendant? Martha is Victoria's ancestor, so Victoria descends from Martha.\n\nMartha is Christian's descendant? Christian is Martha's ancestor, so Martha descends from Christian.\n\nChristian is Alexis's descendant? Alexis is Christian's ancestor, so Christian descends from Alexis.\n\nAlexis is Philip's descendant? Philip is Alexis's ancestor, so Alexis descends from Philip.\n\nPhilip is Diana's descendant.\n\nDiana is Helen's descendant.\n\nHelen is Timothy's descendant.\n\nTimothy is Alan's descendant? Alan is Timothy's ancestor, so Timothy descends from Alan.\n\nAlan is Steven's descendant? Steven is Alan's ancestor, so Alan descends from Steven.\n\nSteven is Juan's descendant.\n\nJuan is Megan's descendant? Megan is Juan's ancestor, so Juan descends from Megan.\n\nMegan is Evelyn's descendant? Evelyn is Megan's ancestor, so Megan descends from Evelyn.\n\nEvelyn is Anthony's descendant? Anthony is Evelyn's ancestor, so Evelyn descends from Anthony.\n\nAnthony is Joyce's descendant.\n\nJoyce is Janice's descendant.\n\nJanice is Albert's descendant.\n\nAlbert is Elizabeth's descendant.\n\nElizabeth is Eugene's descendant.\n\nEugene is Harold's descendant.\n\nHarold is Bobby's descendant.\n\nBobby is Roy's descendant.\n\nSo same chain.\n\nNow, back to Roy and Brittany.\n\nRoy is the start, Brittany is the end, so Roy is ancestor.\n\nBut is there any indication that they are the same person or something? No.\n\nPerhaps I need to see if Brittany is also an ancestor of Roy or something, but that would be impossible unless cycle, but lineage shouldn't have cycles.\n\nAll relationships are one-way, so no cycles.\n\nTherefore, Roy is an ancestor of Brittany.\n\nSo the answer should be option 1.\n\nBut let me see the other options.\n\nOption 2: share common ancestor. Well, Roy is an ancestor, so technically yes, but it might not be the best answer since it's direct.\n\nBut in multiple choice, option 1 is specific.\n\nOption 3: Roy is descendant, which is opposite.\n\nOption 4: share common descendant, which might be true if they have a common descendant, but since Roy is ancestor of Brittany, any descendant of Brittany is also descendant of Roy, so they share common descendants, like Brittany herself or others.\n\nBut that might be true, but option 1 is more direct.\n\nFor example, if A is ancestor of B, then A and B share common descendants, specifically B and B's descendants.\n\nBut the phrase \"share a common descendant\" might imply that there is a descendant that both have, but since A is ancestor, any descendant of B is also descendant of A, so yes.\n\nBut in context, probably option 1 is the intended.\n\nMoreover, option 2 \"share a common ancestor\" is also true, since Roy is an ancestor of both, but Roy is not an ancestor of himself; for Roy and Brittany, Roy has no ancestor in this context, I think.\n\n\"Share a common ancestor\" typically means there is a third person C such that C is ancestor of both.\n\nFor example, if A and B are siblings, they share a common ancestor parent.\n\nBut if A is direct ancestor of B, then C could be A, but A is not ancestor of A.\n\nSo strictly, if A is ancestor of B, then they do not share a common ancestor other than themselves, but it's messy.\n\nIn genealogy, when we say \"share a common ancestor,\" it usually implies a person further back that both descend from, not one being the direct ancestor.\n\nFor instance, cousins share a common grandparent, not that one is the parent.\n\nSo in this case, since Roy is the direct ancestor, option 1 should be chosen.\n\nIf they were cousins, then option 2.\n\nBut here, it's direct line.\n\nTo confirm, is there a shorter path or something?\n\nAnother thing: in the list, there is Bobby who is connected to both, but Bobby is descendant of Roy and ancestor of Harold, who is in Brittany's line.\n\nIn the chain, Bobby is part of it.\n\nBut Roy is before Bobby.\n\nPerhaps I can see if Brittany has another ancestor that connects.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nLet me see if Roy and Brittany have a common ancestor elsewhere.\n\nFor example, from the chain, the earliest is Roy, or further?\n\nIn my chain, Roy is the start, but actually, Roy might have ancestors, but no information given.\n\nSimilarly, Brittany has descendants, but not relevant.\n\nThe relationships only give partial, but in this case, we have a path from Roy to Brittany.\n\nPerhaps there is someone above Roy.\n\nBut since no information, we assume Roy is an ancestor in this context.\n\nSimilarly, for Brittany, she might be the last, but not specified.\n\nBut for the relationship between them, we can say Roy is ancestor.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's see if there is any contradiction.\n\nFor example, is there a statement that might imply otherwise?\n\nOne thing: in the list, we have \"Elizabeth is Albert's ancestor\" and \"Albert is Janice's ancestor\", etc., all consistent.\n\nAnother point: \"Joyce is Janice's descendant\" and \"Anthony is Joyce's descendant\", so Anthony descends from Joyce, who descends from Janice, etc.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the entire tree.\n\nBut I think it's solid.\n\nSo, Roy is Brittany's ancestor.\n\nTherefore, option 1.\n\nBut let me see the answer choices again.\n\nSelect the correct answer:\n\n1. Roy is Brittany's ancestor.\n\n2. Roy and Brittany share a common ancestor.\n\n3. Roy is Brittany's descendant.\n\n4. Roy and Brittany share a common descendant.\n\n5. None of the above.\n\nBased on this, 1 seems correct.\n\nPerhaps I should check if they share a common descendant.\n\nFor example, if Brittany has a child, then Roy and Brittany both have that child as descendant, since Roy is ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, any descendant of Brittany is a descendant of Roy.\n\nSo technically, they share common descendants.\n\nBut option 4 says \"share a common descendant,\" which is true, but option 1 is also true and more specific to the relationship.\n\nIn multiple choice, probably they expect the direct relationship.\n\nMoreover, if I choose option 4, it might be true but not the primary relationship.\n\nSimilarly, option 2 might be misinterpreting.\n\nBut let me see if there is no direct line.\n\nAnother thought: in the chain, I have Anthony to Evelyn, and Anthony is Evelyn's ancestor? \"Anthony is Evelyn's ancestor\" so Evelyn descends from Anthony.\n\nThen Evelyn to Megan, Evelyn is Megan's ancestor, so Megan descends from Evelyn.\n\nThen to Juan, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can find a connection without the long chain.\n\nFor example, from Roy to Bobby to Harold to Eugene to Elizabeth to Albert to Janice to Joyce to Anthony.\n\nNow Anthony is Evelyn's ancestor.\n\nEvelyn is Megan's ancestor.\n\nMegan is Juan's ancestor.\n\nJuan is Steven's ancestor? Steven is Juan's descendant, so Steven descends from Juan.\n\nSteven is Alan's ancestor.\n\nAlan is Timothy's ancestor.\n\nTimothy is Helen's ancestor?
