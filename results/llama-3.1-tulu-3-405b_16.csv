From these relationships, we can see that:
- Kelly is connected to Kathryn through Noah (Kelly -> Noah -> Kathryn).
- Gregory is connected to Alice through Sandra (Gregory -> Sandra -> Alice).

Since Kathryn and Alice are not directly connected in the given relationships, we need to check if they share a common ancestor or descendant.

**Common Ancestor:**
- Kathryn is Dylan's ancestor.
- Natalie is Dylan's ancestor.
- Peter is Natalie's ancestor.
- Alice is Sandra's ancestor.
- Gregory is Sandra's descendant.

4. **Marie is Brenda's descendant.**
5. **Mark is Walter's descendant.**
6. **Patrick is Jerry's descendant.**
7. **Patrick is Joseph's ancestor.**
   - Therefore, Patrick is also Carolyn's ancestor (since Joseph is Carolyn's ancestor).

8. **Walter is Thomas's descendant.**
   - Therefore, Mark is also Thomas's descendant (since Mark is Walter's descendant).

9. **Mark is Aaron's ancestor.**
   - Therefore, Mark is also Jerry's ancestor (since Jerry is Aaron's descendant).

10. **Linda is Jonathan's descendant.**
11. **Linda is Cynthia's ancestor.**

Now, let's summarize the key relationships relevant to Steven and Thomas:

- **Steven** is Cynthia's descendant (through Billy).
- **Thomas** is Walter's ancestor (since Walter is Thomas's descendant).

We need to find a common link between Steven and Thomas. 

- **Mark** is Thomas's descendant (since Mark is Walter's descendant).
- **Mark** is also Aaron's ancestor (since Mark is Aaron's ancestor).

Since Mark is both Thomas's descendant and Aaron's ancestor, and Aaron is Jerry's descendant, we can trace the lineage further:

- **Patrick** is Jerry's ancestor (since Patrick is Jerry's descendant).
- **Patrick** is also Joseph's ancestor (since Patrick is Joseph's ancestor).

Thus, Patrick links both Thomas (through Mark) and Steven (through Billy and Cynthia).

Therefore, Steven and Thomas share a common ancestor (Patrick).

3. **Common Ancestor:**
   - From Michael's lineage: Sandra.
   - From Adam's lineage: Emily.

We need to check if Sandra and Emily are connected in any way. The given relationships do not directly connect Sandra and Emily. However, we have one more piece of information:
   - Emily is Tyler's descendant.
   - Tyler's ancestry traces back to Thomas (Thomas is Tyler's ancestor).
   - Thomas's ancestry traces back to Marilyn (Marilyn is Thomas's ancestor).
   - Marilyn's descent traces back to Sandra (Sandra is Marilyn's descendant).

Thus, Sandra is an ancestor of Emily. This means Sandra is a common ancestor for both Michael and Adam.

13. **Amanda is Edward's ancestor.**
14. **Ethan is Amanda's ancestor.**
15. **Willie is Ethan's ancestor.**

From these relationships, we can establish the following lineage:
- Joseph → Melissa → Lisa → Richard → Olivia → Joan → Juan → Christian → Walter → Edward → Amanda → Ethan → Willie

Now, we have two lineages:
1. Noah → Shirley → Anthony → Willie
2. Joseph → Melissa → Lisa → Richard → Olivia → Joan → Juan → Christian → Walter → Edward → Amanda → Ethan → Willie

Both lineages end with Willie, indicating that Willie is a common descendant of both Noah and Joseph.
