Hmm, first I need to map out all the given relationships step by step. Let me list out each statement and see how they connect.\n\nStarting with the given:\n\n1. Doris is Maria's ancestor.\n2. Bradley is Maria's descendant.\n3. Alexis is Heather's ancestor.\n4. Doris is William's descendant.\n5. Frances is Heather's descendant.\n6. Alexis is Eugene's descendant.\n7. Frances is William's ancestor.\n\nWait, let me parse each one carefully. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, \"Doris is Maria's ancestor.\" So Doris → Maria (Doris is above Maria in the lineage).\n\n\"Bradley is Maria's descendant.\" So Maria → Bradley (Maria is above Bradley).\n\n\"Alexis is Heather's ancestor.\" So Alexis → Heather.\n\n\"Doris is William's descendant.\" Wait, Doris is a descendant of William? So William → Doris.\n\n\"Frances is Heather's descendant.\" Heather → Frances.\n\n\"Alexis is Eugene's descendant.\" Wait, that's Alexis being a descendant of Eugene? Wait, no. Wait, \"Alexis is Eugene's descendant\" would mean Eugene is the ancestor, so Eugene → Alexis.\n\n\"Frances is William's ancestor.\" So Frances → William.\n\nHmm, let's try to build a family tree.\n\nLet me start by listing all the people mentioned: Doris, Maria, Bradley, Alexis, Heather, William, Frances, Eugene.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom statement 7: Frances is William's ancestor. So Frances → William.\n\nStatement 4: Doris is William's descendant. So William → Doris.\n\nWait, Frances → William → Doris.\n\nBut statement 1: Doris is Maria's ancestor. So Doris → Maria.\n\nStatement 2: Bradley is Maria's descendant. So Maria → Bradley.\n\nSo putting that chain together: Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nNow, statement 3: Alexis is Heather's ancestor. So Alexis → Heather.\n\nStatement 5: Frances is Heather's descendant. Wait, Frances is Heather's descendant? Wait, statement 5 says \"Frances is Heather's descendant,\" so Heather → Frances.\n\nWait, but statement 7 says Frances is William's ancestor. So Heather → Frances → William.\n\nWait, let's check that again. Statement 5: Frances is Heather's descendant. So Heather is the ancestor, Frances is descendant. So Heather → Frances.\n\nStatement 7: Frances is William's ancestor. So Frances → William.\n\nSo Heather → Frances → William.\n\nEarlier, we had Frances → William from statement 7, and Heather → Frances from statement 5. So Heather → Frances → William.\n\nThen statement 4: Doris is William's descendant. So William → Doris.\n\nSo Heather → Frances → William → Doris.\n\nThen statement 1: Doris is Maria's ancestor. So Doris → Maria.\n\nStatement 2: Bradley is Maria's descendant. Maria → Bradley.\n\nSo Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nNow, statement 6: Alexis is Eugene's descendant. Wait, \"Alexis is Eugene's descendant\" means Eugene → Alexis.\n\nStatement 3: Alexis is Heather's ancestor. So Alexis → Heather.\n\nWait, so Alexis → Heather (from statement 3), and Eugene → Alexis (from statement 6). So Eugene → Alexis → Heather.\n\nBut Heather is connected to the other chain: Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nEugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nWait, so Eugene is an ancestor of Alexis, who is an ancestor of Heather, who is an ancestor of Frances, etc., down to Bradley.\n\nTherefore, Eugene would be an ancestor of Bradley. Because Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nSo Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley. So the answer would be option 1.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nLet's confirm each step.\n\nStatement 6: Alexis is Eugene's descendant. So Eugene is the ancestor, Alexis is descendant. So Eugene → Alexis.\n\nStatement 3: Alexis is Heather's ancestor. So Alexis → Heather.\n\nTherefore, Eugene → Alexis → Heather.\n\nStatement 5: Frances is Heather's descendant. So Heather → Frances.\n\nStatement 7: Frances is William's ancestor. So Frances → William.\n\nStatement 4: Doris is William's descendant. So William → Doris.\n\nStatement 1: Doris is Maria's ancestor. Doris → Maria.\n\nStatement 2: Bradley is Maria's descendant. Maria → Bradley.\n\nSo combining all:\n\nEugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nTherefore, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley. So option 1.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any possibility of another connection. Are there any other branches?\n\nWait, all the given relationships are connected through this chain. Let's see.\n\nIs there any other way? Let's check again.\n\nWait, statement 6 says \"Alexis is Eugene's descendant,\" which would mean Eugene is the ancestor. So Eugene → Alexis.\n\nStatement 3: Alexis is Heather's ancestor, so Alexis → Heather.\n\nSo yes, Eugene → Alexis → Heather.\n\nHeather → Frances (statement 5), Frances → William (statement 7), William → Doris (statement 4), Doris → Maria (statement 1), Maria → Bradley (statement 2).\n\nTherefore, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley. So answer 1.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's any contradiction. Let's make sure all the statements are satisfied.\n\nCheck statement 7: Frances is William's ancestor. Yes, Frances → William.\n\nStatement 4: Doris is William's descendant. William → Doris. Correct.\n\nStatement 1: Doris is Maria's ancestor. Doris → Maria. Correct.\n\nStatement 2: Bradley is Maria's descendant. Maria → Bradley. Correct.\n\nStatement 5: Frances is Heather's descendant. Heather → Frances. Correct.\n\nStatement 3: Alexis is Heather's ancestor. Alexis → Heather. Correct.\n\nStatement 6: Alexis is Eugene's descendant. Eugene → Alexis. Correct.\n\nAll statements are satisfied in this chain. So Eugene is indeed an ancestor of Bradley.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley, then yes, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley. So the correct answer should be option 1.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\n1. Eugene is Bradley's ancestor.\n\n2. Eugene and Bradley share a common ancestor.\n\n3. Eugene is Bradley's descendant.\n\n4. Eugene and Bradley share a common descendant.\n\n5. None of the above.\n\nSo according to this chain, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley, so option 1.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any of the directions.\n\nFor example, \"Doris is Maria's ancestor\" means Doris is above Maria, so Doris → Maria.\n\n\"Bradley is Maria's descendant\" means Maria → Bradley.\n\nSimilarly, \"Alexis is Heather's ancestor\" → Alexis → Heather.\n\n\"Frances is Heather's descendant\" → Heather → Frances.\n\n\"Frances is William's ancestor\" → Frances → William.\n\n\"Doris is William's descendant\" → William → Doris.\n\n\"Alexis is Eugene's descendant\" → Eugene → Alexis.\n\nYes, so all the arrows go in the direction of ancestor to descendant.\n\nSo the chain is Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nTherefore, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley. So answer 1.\n\nHmm. But wait, let's check if there's any other possible connection. For example, could there be another path where Eugene and Bradley are related differently?\n\nBut all the given information seems to form a single chain connecting Eugene to Bradley through the above path. There's no mention of any other relationships, so this should be the only path.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option 1.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let's check if \"Alexis is Eugene's descendant\" is correctly interpreted. If Alexis is Eugene's descendant, then Eugene is the ancestor, so Eugene → Alexis. Yes.\n\nAnd \"Alexis is Heather's ancestor\" so Alexis → Heather. So Eugene → Alexis → Heather.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo all the links are there. So Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more to be absolutely sure.\n\nAnother way: Let's list all the ancestors and descendants.\n\nStarting from Eugene:\n\nEugene's descendant is Alexis (statement 6).\n\nAlexis's descendant is Heather (statement 3 says Alexis is Heather's ancestor, so Heather is descendant of Alexis).\n\nHeather's descendant is Frances (statement 5: Frances is Heather's descendant).\n\nFrances's descendant is William (statement 7: Frances is William's ancestor, so William is descendant of Frances).\n\nWilliam's descendant is Doris (statement 4: Doris is William's descendant).\n\nDoris's descendant is Maria (statement 1: Doris is Maria's ancestor, so Maria is descendant of Doris).\n\nMaria's descendant is Bradley (statement 2: Bradley is Maria's descendant).\n\nSo the chain of descendants from Eugene is:\n\nEugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nTherefore, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley. So answer 1.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be 1.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\n1. Eugene is Bradley's ancestor.\n\nYes. So option 1.\n\nBut let me check if maybe I misread any of the statements.\n\nWait, statement 6: \"Alexis is Eugene's descendant.\" So Eugene is the ancestor. So Eugene → Alexis.\n\nStatement 3: \"Alexis is Heather's ancestor.\" So Alexis → Heather.\n\nSo yes, Eugene → Alexis → Heather.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother check: Frances is William's ancestor (statement 7), so Frances → William. Then William → Doris (statement 4), Doris → Maria (statement 1), Maria → Bradley (statement 2). So Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nAnd Heather → Frances (statement 5), so Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nAlexis → Heather (statement 3), so Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nEugene → Alexis (statement 6), so Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley.\n\nThus, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1.\n","reasoning_details":[{"format":"unknown","index":0,"type":"reasoning.text","text":"Okay, let's try to figure out the lineage relationship between Eugene and Bradley.
