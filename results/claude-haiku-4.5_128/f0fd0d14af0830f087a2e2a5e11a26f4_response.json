I need to find the lineage relationship between Keith and Betty.\n\nFirst, let me understand the notation:\n- \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X is older in the lineage (Y is descended from X)\n- \"X is Y's descendant\" means X is younger in the lineage (X descended from Y)\n\nLet me trace the lineage starting from Keith:\n\nKeith is Andrew's ancestor.\nAndrew is Bryan's ancestor.\nBryan is Jordan's ancestor.\n\nLet me trace from Betty:\nBetty is Sophia's descendant.\nSophia is Kelly's descendant.\nKelly is Linda's descendant.\n\nWait, let me re-read:\n- \"Betty is Sophia's descendant\" means Sophia is Betty's ancestor\n- \"Sophia is Kelly's descendant\" means Kelly is Sophia's ancestor\n- Let me continue...\n\nActually, let me organize this better. Let me create a mapping of who is whose ancestor/descendant.\n\nFrom \"Betty is Sophia's descendant\":\nSophia → Betty (Sophia is ancestor of Betty)\n\nFrom \"Sophia is Kelly's descendant\":\nKelly → Sophia (Kelly is ancestor of Sophia)\n\nFrom \"Linda is Kelly's ancestor\":\nLinda → Kelly (Linda is ancestor of Kelly)\n\nFrom \"Linda is Billy's descendant\":\nBilly → Linda (Billy is ancestor of Linda)\n\nFrom \"Dylan is Billy's ancestor\":\nDylan → Billy (Dylan is ancestor of Billy)\n\nFrom \"John is Dylan's ancestor\":\nJohn → Dylan (John is ancestor of Dylan)\n\nLet me trace Keith:\nKeith is Andrew's ancestor → Keith → Andrew\nAndrew is Bryan's ancestor → Andrew → Bryan\nBryan is Jordan's ancestor → Bryan → Jordan\n\nHmm, I need to find if there's a connection between the Keith line and the Betty line.\n\nLet me work on the Betty line more carefully:\nBetty is Sophia's descendant: Sophia → Betty\nSophia is Kelly's descendant: Kelly → Sophia\nKelly is a descendant of Linda (from Linda is Kelly's ancestor): Linda → Kelly\n\n\nLinda is a descendant of Billy: Billy → Linda\nBilly is a descendant of Dylan: Dylan → Billy\nDylan is a descendant of John: John → Dylan\n\nSo the full chain is: John → Dylan → Billy → Linda → Kelly → Sophia → Betty\n\nNow for Keith's line: Keith → Andrew → Bryan → Jordan\n\nI need to find where these two chains connect. Let me look for any relationships involving Jordan, John, or the people between them.\n\nTracing through the other relationships: Sean → Ann → Brian, and Brian → Sharon → Noah → Bobby. Bobby connects back to Ashley, with Ashley → Jesse.\n\nI'm checking if Jordan has any other connections that would link to the John-Dylan-Billy chain, but so far the two lineages appear separate. I need to find the bridge between them to determine the full family tree.\n\nFollowing the path backward from Betty: Sophia → Kelly ← Linda ← Billy ← Dylan ← John. This chain extends further when I trace John's ancestry: Wayne → John, and Wayne comes from Bradley, who descends from Anthony, Elijah, Kyle, and continuing back through Denise, Carol, Judith, Marilyn, William, Jessica, James, Hannah, and Danielle. This creates a much longer ancestral line that I need to connect to the Keith branch to see the complete structure. Kyle → Elijah → Anthony → Bradley → Wayne → John → Dylan → Billy → Linda → Kelly → Sophia → Betty\n\nJoshua connects to the entire line through Timothy, making him an ancestor of everyone down to Betty. Now I need to determine if Keith's line intersects with this chain. Tracing from Keith: Keith → Andrew → Bryan → Jordan. I should search for where Jordan fits in the established ancestry to see if there's a connection point.\n\nLet me check Christian's line since it might bridge to the main chain. Zachary → Christian → Michael, and Michael connects to Jennifer → Ethan. From there, Ethan → Cheryl → Joshua. This means Joshua is actually an ancestor of the entire Timothy line, which traces all the way down to Betty. Wayne → John → Dylan → Billy → Linda → Kelly → Sophia → Betty\n\nNow I need to work backwards from Cheryl. Ethan → Cheryl, and tracing further back: Jennifer → Ethan, Michael → Jennifer, Christian → Michael, and Zachary → Christian. This gives me the full chain: Zachary → Christian → Michael → Jennifer → Ethan → Cheryl → Joshua → ... → Betty.\n\nI should check if Zachary connects to Andrew or Keith. Following the descendant relationships: Daniel → Zachary, Kimberly → Daniel, and Ronald → Kimberly, so Ronald is at the top of this branch.\n\nContinuing backwards from Ronald: Evelyn → Ronald, Grace → Evelyn, Mary → Grace, and Debra → Mary. This extends the chain to: Debra → Mary → Grace → Evelyn → Ronald → Kimberly → Daniel → Zachary → Christian → Michael → Jennifer → Ethan → Cheryl → Joshua → ... → Betty.\n\nTo connect Debra to Keith, I trace further: Jeffrey → Debra, Isabella → Jeffrey, Kathleen → Isabella, Henry → Kathleen, and Jesse → Henry. This gives me: Jesse → Henry → Kathleen → Isabella → Jeffrey → Debra → Mary → Grace → Evelyn → Ronald → Kimberly → Daniel → Zachary → Christian → Michael → Jennifer → Ethan → Cheryl → Joshua → ... → Betty.\n\nNow I need to find Jesse's ancestors. Ashley → Jesse, and I need to continue from Bobby.\n\nBobby → Ashley, Noah → Bobby, Sharon → Noah, Brian → Sharon, Ann → Brian, and Sean → Ann. This extends the chain to: Sean → Ann → Brian → Sharon → Noah → Bobby → Ashley → Jesse → Henry → Kathleen → Isabella → Jeffrey → Debra → Mary → Grace → Evelyn → Ronald → Kimberly → Daniel → Zachary → Christian → Michael → Jennifer → Ethan → Cheryl → Joshua → ... → Betty.\n\nThomas → Sean, so: Thomas → Sean → Ann → Brian → Sharon → Noah → Bobby → Ashley → Jesse → Henry → Kathleen → Isabella → Jeffrey → Debra → Mary → Grace → Evelyn → Ronald → Kimberly → Daniel → Zachary → Christian → Michael → Jennifer → Ethan → Cheryl → Joshua → ... → Betty.\n\nTeresa → Thomas, extending the chain further: Teresa → Thomas → Sean → Ann → Brian → Sharon → Noah → Bobby → Ashley → Jesse → Henry.\n\nFrom \"Teresa is Alexis's descendant\": Alexis → Teresa. From \"Natalie is Alexis's ancestor\": Natalie → Alexis. From \"Natalie is Jack's descendant\": Jack → Natalie. This gives me: Jack → Natalie → Alexis → Teresa → Thomas → Sean → Ann → Brian → Sharon → Noah → Bobby → Ashley → Jesse → Henry → Kathleen → Isabella → Jeffrey → Debra → Mary → Grace → Evelyn → Ronald → Kimberly → Daniel → Zachary → Christian → Michael → Jennifer → Ethan → Cheryl → Joshua → ... → Betty.\n\nI need to continue tracing back from Jack to find Eugene and eventually Andrew.\n\nFrom \"Jack is Eugene's descendant\": Eugene → Jack. From \"Gregory is Eugene's ancestor\": Gregory → Eugene. From \"Anna is Gregory's ancestor\": Anna → Gregory. From \"Russell is Anna's ancestor\": Russell → Anna.\n\nSo the full chain extends back to Russell: Russell → Anna → Gregory → Eugene → Jack → Natalie → Alexis → Teresa → Thomas → Sean → Ann → Brian → Sharon → Noah → Bobby → Ashley → Jesse → Henry → Kathleen → Isabella → Jeffrey → Debra → Mary → Grace → Evelyn → Ronald → Kimberly → Daniel → Zachary → Christian → Michael → Jennifer → Ethan → Cheryl → Joshua → ... → Betty.\n\nFrom \"Russell is Jean's descendant\": Jean → Russell. From \"Jean is Julia's descendant\": Julia → Jean. From \"Julia is Carl's descendant\": Carl → Julia.\n\nThis extends the chain further back: Carl → Julia → Jean → Russell → Anna → Gregory → Eugene → Jack → Natalie → Alexis → Teresa → Thomas → Sean → Ann → Brian → Sharon → Noah → Bobby → Ashley → Jesse → Henry → Kathleen → Isabella → Jeffrey → Debra → Mary → Grace → Evelyn → Ronald → Kimberly → Daniel → Zachary → Christian → Michael → Jennifer → Ethan → Cheryl → Joshua → ... → Betty.\n\nFrom \"Scott is Carl's ancestor\": Scott → Carl. From \"Steven is Scott's ancestor\": Steven → Scott.\n\nSo the full lineage traces back to Steven: Steven → Scott → Carl → Julia → Jean → Russell → Anna → Gregory → Eugene → Jack → Natalie → Alexis → Teresa → Thomas → Sean → Ann → Brian → Sharon → Noah → Bobby → Ashley → Jesse → Henry → Kathleen → Isabella → Jeffrey → Debra → Mary → Grace → Evelyn → Ronald → Kimberly → Daniel → Zachary → Christian → Michael → Jennifer → Ethan → Cheryl → Joshua → ... → Betty.\n\nSince Steven is Randy's descendant, Randy must come before Steven in the chain: Randy → Steven. And since Alice is Randy's ancestor, Alice precedes Randy: Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → Carl → Julia → Jean → Russell → Anna → Gregory → Eugene → Jack → Natalie → Alexis → Teresa → Thomas → Sean → Ann → Brian → Sharon → Noah → Bobby → Ashley → Jesse → Henry → Kathleen → Isabella → Jeffrey → Debra → Mary → Grace → Evelyn → Ronald → Kimberly → Daniel → Zachary → Christian → Michael → Jennifer → Ethan → Cheryl → Joshua → ... → Betty.\n\nI still need to place Keith in this sequence. Looking at the remaining connections: Keith → Andrew → Bryan → Jordan. I haven't found where Jordan fits into the main chain yet, which suggests I may need to reconsider how these branches connect. I've traced a long lineage from Alice all the way through to Betty, but I haven't yet identified who Alice's ancestors are. The Keith → Andrew → Bryan → Jordan chain appears to be completely separate from this main line. Let me examine what ancestral connections Alice might have that I haven't explored yet. I need to trace back further to find Maria's ancestors. Maria descends from Adam, who descends from David. David's ancestor is Martha, and Martha's ancestor is Helen, who descends from Bruce. This gives me the full chain: Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nContinuing backward, Rachel is Bruce's ancestor, and Kayla is Rachel's ancestor. From there, Shirley is Kayla's ancestor, and Mark is Shirley's ancestor. I'm building the complete lineage: Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nBarbara is Mark's ancestor, and Donna is Barbara's ancestor. Beverly is Donna's ancestor, and Pamela is Beverly's ancestor. So the chain extends further back: Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nEmily is Pamela's ancestor, continuing the lineage upward.\n\nJoan is Emily's ancestor, and Brandon is Joan's ancestor. Deborah is Brandon's ancestor, extending the chain all the way back to: Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nNow I need to trace back further from Deborah to find any remaining ancestors. Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty\n\nContinuing to trace back through the ancestry: Melissa is Amanda's ancestor, so Melissa → Amanda. Then Sara is Melissa's ancestor, giving Sara → Melissa → Amanda, and this extends the full chain back to Sara at the beginning.\n\nWorking further back, Albert is Sara's ancestor, then Alan is Albert's ancestor. Jerry comes before Alan in the lineage, and Patrick is Jerry's ancestor, so the complete chain becomes Patrick → Jerry → Alan → Albert → Sara → Melissa → Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nJoseph is Patrick's ancestor, and since Lauren is Joseph's ancestor, I can extend the chain further: Lauren → Joseph → Patrick → Jerry → Alan → Albert → Sara → Melissa → Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nCarolyn is Lauren's ancestor, so the lineage now starts with Carolyn → Lauren → Joseph → Patrick → Jerry → Alan → Albert → Sara → Melissa → Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nAmber is Carolyn's ancestor, Patricia is Amber's ancestor, and Willie is Patricia's ancestor. Juan is Willie's ancestor, so the complete chain is: Juan → Willie → Patricia → Amber → Carolyn → Lauren → Joseph → Patrick → Jerry → Alan → Albert → Sara → Melissa → Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nKathryn is Juan's ancestor, extending the line further back. Now I need to trace Kathryn's own ancestors. Ryan is Kathryn's descendant, meaning Ryan → Kathryn, which continues the chain: Ryan → Kathryn → Juan → Willie → Patricia → Amber → Carolyn → Lauren → Joseph → Patrick → Jerry → Alan → Albert → Sara → Melissa → Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nRobert is Ryan's ancestor, so Robert → Ryan. This extends the chain further back: Robert → Ryan → Kathryn → Juan → Willie → Patricia → Amber → Carolyn → Lauren → Joseph → Patrick → Jerry → Alan → Albert → Sara → Melissa → Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nJoe is Robert's ancestor, so Joe → Robert. This gives me: Joe → Robert → Ryan → Kathryn → Juan → Willie → Patricia → Amber → Carolyn → Lauren → Joseph → Patrick → Jerry → Alan → Albert → Sara → Melissa → Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nKatherine is Joe's ancestor, so Katherine → Joe. This extends it further: Katherine → Joe → Robert → Ryan → Kathryn → Juan → Willie → Patricia → Amber → Carolyn → Lauren → Joseph → Patrick → Jerry → Alan → Albert → Sara → Melissa → Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nCynthia is Katherine's ancestor, so Cynthia → Katherine. This gives me: Cynthia → Katherine → Joe → Robert → Ryan → Kathryn → Juan → Willie → Patricia → Amber → Carolyn → Lauren → Joseph → Patrick → Jerry → Alan → Albert → Sara → Melissa → Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nNow I need to trace back from Cynthia. Jordan is Cynthia's ancestor, so Jordan → Cynthia. This extends the chain to: Jordan → Cynthia → Katherine → Joe → Robert → Ryan → Kathryn → Juan → Willie → Patricia → Amber → Carolyn → Lauren → Joseph → Patrick → Jerry → Alan → Albert → Sara → Melissa → Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nI also have Keith → Andrew → Bryan → Jordan. Connecting these: Keith → Andrew → Bryan → Jordan → Cynthia → ... → Betty.

Jordan is Cynthia's ancestor, so Jordan → Cynthia. This extends the chain to: Jordan → Cynthia → Katherine → Joe → Robert → Ryan → Kathryn → Juan → Willie → Patricia → Amber → Carolyn → Lauren → Joseph → Patrick → Jerry → Alan → Albert → Sara → Melissa → Amanda → Christopher → Megan → Jonathan → Deborah → Brandon → Joan → Emily → Pamela → Beverly → Donna → Barbara → Mark → Shirley → Kayla → Rachel → Bruce → Helen → Martha → David → Adam → Maria → Alice → Randy → Steven → Scott → ... → Betty.\n\nI also have Keith → Andrew → Bryan → Jordan. Connecting these: Keith → Andrew → Bryan → Jordan → Cynthia → ... → Betty. So Keith is Betty's
