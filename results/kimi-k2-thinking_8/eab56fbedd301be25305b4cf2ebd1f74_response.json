We have a set of lineage relationships: \"X is Y's descendant\" means X is a descendant of Y (i.e., Y is an ancestor of X). \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X is an ancestor of Y. So we have a directed graph of ancestor/descendant relationships. The problem asks: Determine the lineage relationship between Steven and Robert.\n\nGiven statements:\n\n1. Christine is Diane's descendant. => Christine <?? Actually \"descendant\" means Christine is a descendant of Diane: Diane is ancestor of Christine. So directed edge: Diane -> Christine (ancestor to descendant). Or we can treat as \"ancestor\" relation: Diane ancestor Christine.\n\n2. William is Diane's ancestor. => William is ancestor of Diane: William ancestor Diane.\n\n3. Christine is Peter's ancestor. => Christine ancestor Peter.\n\n4. William is Albert's descendant. => William descendant of Albert: Albert ancestor William.\n\n5. Robert is Zachary's descendant. => Robert descendant of Zachary: Zachary ancestor Robert.\n\n6. Peter is Zachary's ancestor. => Peter ancestor Zachary.\n\n7. Steven is Albert's ancestor. => Steven ancestor Albert.\n\nGoal: Determine relationship between Steven and Robert. Options: share a common ancestor, Steven descendant of Robert, Steven ancestor of Robert, share a common descendant, none.\n\nWe need to see if we can deduce any relationship.\n\nWe have a set of individuals: Diane, Christine, William, Peter, Albert, Zachary, Robert, Steven.\n\nRelationships:\n\n- Diane ancestor Christine (1)\n- William ancestor Diane (2)\n- Christine ancestor Peter (3)\n- Albert ancestor William (4)\n- Zachary ancestor Robert (5)\n- Peter ancestor Zachary (6)\n- Steven ancestor Albert (7)\n\nThus we have a chain: Steven -> Albert -> William -> Diane -> Christine -> Peter -> Zachary -> Robert.\n\nLet's verify: Steven ancestor Albert (7). Albert ancestor William (4). William ancestor Diane (2). Diane ancestor Christine (1). Christine ancestor Peter (3). Peter ancestor Zachary (6). Zachary ancestor Robert (5). So indeed we have a linear chain: Steven > Albert > William > Diane > Christine > Peter > Zachary > Robert (where \">\" denotes ancestor relationship). So Steven is an ancestor of Robert (through the chain). So answer: Steven is Robert's ancestor.\n\nThus answer option 3.\n\nDouble-check: Are there any other possible relationships? Could there be any branching? The statements only give these relationships; we can assume they are consistent and no contradictory statements. The chain is linear.

The question likely expects the most direct relationship. In genealogical terms, if A is ancestor of B, then they also share common ancestors (the same as A's ancestors). But the question is ambiguous: \"Determine the lineage relationship between Steven and Robert.\" Usually we answer with the most direct relationship (ancestor/descendant).
