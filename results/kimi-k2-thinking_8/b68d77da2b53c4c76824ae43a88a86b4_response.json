We have a set of statements about lineage relationships: descendant/ancestor. We need to determine the relationship between Scott and Doris.\n\nThe statements:\n\n1. Scott is Rachel's descendant.\n2. Kevin is Walter's descendant.\n3. Jesse is Kevin's descendant.\n4. Rachel is Jesse's descendant.\n5. Helen is Jacob's descendant.\n6. Helen is Doris's ancestor.\n7. Walter is Jacob's ancestor.\n\nWe need to find the relationship between Scott and Doris.\n\nWe need to interpret \"descendant\" and \"ancestor\" as direct or indirect? Typically in genealogy, \"descendant\" means descendant (child, grandchild, etc.) and \"ancestor\" means ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.). So we can treat these as directed edges: A is B's descendant => B is A's ancestor. Conversely, A is B's ancestor => B is A's descendant.\n\nThus we can build a directed graph: edges from ancestor to descendant? Or from descendant to ancestor? Let's define directed edges: If X is Y's descendant, then Y -> X (Y is ancestor, X is descendant). So we can represent each relationship as a directed edge from the ancestor to the descendant.\n\nThus:\n\n1. Scott is Rachel's descendant => Rachel -> Scott.\n2. Kevin is Walter's descendant => Walter -> Kevin.\n3. Jesse is Kevin's descendant => Kevin -> Jesse.\n4. Rachel is Jesse's descendant => Jesse -> Rachel.\n5. Helen is Jacob's descendant => Jacob -> Helen.\n6. Helen is Doris's ancestor => Helen -> Doris? Wait: \"Helen is Doris's ancestor.\" That means Helen is an ancestor of Doris, i.e., Doris is Helen's descendant. So we can write: Helen -> Doris (Helen ancestor, Doris descendant).\n7. Walter is Jacob's ancestor => Walter -> Jacob.\n\nThus we have edges:\n\n- Rachel -> Scott\n- Walter -> Kevin\n- Kevin -> Jesse\n- Jesse -> Rachel\n- Jacob -> Helen\n- Helen -> Doris\n- Walter -> Jacob\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Scott and Doris.\n\nWe need to see if there is a path connecting them, either direction, that indicates ancestor/descendant relationship, or if they share a common ancestor or descendant.\n\nThe answer choices:\n\n1. Scott and Doris share a common descendant.\n2. Scott is Doris's ancestor.\n3. Scott and Doris share a common ancestor.\n4. Scott is Doris's descendant.\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nWe need to see which is correct.\n\nFirst, let's examine the graph.\n\nWe have a chain: Walter -> Kevin -> Jesse -> Rachel -> Scott.\n\nWe also have: Walter -> Jacob -> Helen -> Doris.\n\nThus Walter is a common ancestor of both Scott and Doris (and also of Kevin, Jesse, Rachel, Helen, etc). So Scott and Doris share a common ancestor (Walter). That suggests answer 3.\n\nBut we need to check if there is any direct ancestor/descendant relationship between Scott and Doris.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Scott is descendant of Rachel, who is descendant of Jesse, who is descendant of Kevin, who is descendant of Walter. So Scott is descendant of Walter.\n\n- Doris is descendant of Helen, who is descendant of Jacob, who is descendant of Walter. So Doris is descendant of Walter.\n\nThus both are descendants of Walter. Are they related by descent? Could Scott be ancestor of Doris? No, because Scott is descendant of Walter, and Doris is also descendant of Walter, but there is no path connecting Scott to Doris (neither direction). The graph we have: Walter -> Kevin, Walter -> Jacob. Then Kevin -> Jesse -> Rachel -> Scott. Jacob -> Helen -> Doris.\n\nThus there is no edge linking the two branches. So they share a common ancestor (Walter), but not a common descendant (they are both descendants of Walter, but they don't share a descendant). So answer 3.\n\nBut we need to be careful: The answer \"Scott and Doris share a common ancestor\" is correct. However, we must also check if there is any possibility that they share a common descendant (i.e., they both are ancestors of someone else). The statements only talk about descendant relationships, not about any other individuals. The only individuals mentioned are Scott, Rachel, Kevin, Walter, Jesse, Helen, Jacob, Doris. There is no mention of any other individuals that could be descendant of both Scott and Doris. So we cannot claim they share a common descendant. So answer 3.\n\nThus answer: <ANSWER>3</ANSWER>.\n\nBut we need to double-check the interpretation: Could \"descendant\" be used as immediate child only? Usually descendant includes all generations. So it's fine.\n\nNow, we need to consider the possibility that the answer could be \"None of the above\". But we have a clear common ancestor: Walter. So answer 3.\n\nThus final answer: <ANSWER>3</ANSWER>.\n\nBut we need to think about the possibility that the relationships could be ambiguous: In genealogical terminology, \"descendant\" and \"ancestor\" refer to direct line only; they refer to parent-child relationships (maybe also grandparent?). Usually descendant means any generation. So we can treat them as transitive closure.\n\nThus we can deduce that Walter is ancestor of both Scott and Doris. So they share a common ancestor. So answer 3.\n\nThus final answer: <ANSWER>3</ANSWER>.\n\nNow, we must ensure we follow the instructions: \"Enclose the selected answer number in the <ANSWER> tag, for example: <ANSWER>1</ANSWER>.\"\n\nThus we output: <ANSWER>3</ANSWER>.\n\nWe should not include any other text.
