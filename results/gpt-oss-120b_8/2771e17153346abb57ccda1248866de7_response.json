Let's see if there is any path connecting Andrea and Karen.\n\nWe have Andrea is ancestor of Terry etc. Karen is ancestor of Alice etc. No direct relationship given between those lines. Could there be a common ancestor? Possibly they share a common ancestor further up not mentioned. But based on given info, we cannot deduce a direct ancestor/descendant relationship between Andrea and Karen. However we can deduce they share a common descendant: Christine is a descendant of both Andrea (via chain) and Karen (via chain). Let's verify: Is Christine descendant of Andrea? Path: Andrea -> Terry -> Samuel -> Beverly -> Sandra -> Christine. Yes, each arrow is ancestor relationship, so Andrea is ancestor of Terry, etc., thus Andrea is ancestor of Christine. So Christine is a descendant of Andrea.\n\nSimilarly, Christine is descendant of Karen via Karen -> Alice -> Christine.\n\nThus they share a common descendant (Christine). So answer 2: Andrea and Karen share a common descendant.\n\nCheck other options: 1 says share a common ancestor. Do they share? Not given.
