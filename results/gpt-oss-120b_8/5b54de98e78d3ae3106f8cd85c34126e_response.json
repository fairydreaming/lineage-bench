Let's define ancestor/descendant direction: If X is Y's ancestor, then X is older generation, Y is descendant. So \"Paul is Megan's descendant\" means Paul is descendant of Megan (Megan is ancestor of Paul). \"Jean is Ann's ancestor\" means Jean is ancestor of Ann. \"Judith is Alexander's ancestor\" means Judith ancestor of Alexander. \"Ruth is Judith's ancestor\" means Ruth ancestor of Judith. \"Ruth is Paul's descendant\" means Ruth is descendant of Paul (so Paul ancestor of Ruth). \"Alexander is Anna's descendant\" means Alexander descendant of Anna (Anna ancestor of Alexander). \"Megan is Ann's descendant\" means Megan descendant of Ann (Ann ancestor of Megan).\n\nWe need relationship between Jean and Anna.\n\nLet's build a graph.\n\nWe'll denote edges: A -> B meaning A is ancestor of B (A older). So \"X is Y's ancestor\" => edge X -> Y. \"X is Y's descendant\" => edge Y -> X (since Y ancestor of X). Let's list:\n\n1. Paul is Megan's descendant => Megan -> Paul.\n2. Jean is Ann's ancestor => Jean -> Ann.\n3. Judith is Alexander's ancestor => Judith -> Alexander.\n4. Ruth is Judith's ancestor => Ruth -> Judith.\n5.

Also Ruth is ancestor of Judith, so Ruth -> Judith -> Alexander. Also Paul -> Ruth -> Judith -> Alexander. Also Megan -> Paul -> ... So many.\n\nNow we need relationship between Jean and Anna. We have Jean -> Ann. And Ann -> Megan -> Paul -> Ruth -> Judith -> Alexander. Also Anna -> Alexander. So we have a path from Jean to Ann to ... to Alexander, and from Anna to Alexander.

The question: \"Determine the lineage relationship between Jean and Anna.\" Options:\n\n1. Jean and Anna share a common ancestor.\n2. Jean is Anna's descendant.\n3. Jean and Anna share a common descendant.\n4. Jean is Anna's ancestor.\n5. None of the above.\n\nWe have found they share a common descendant (Alexander). Do they also share a common ancestor?
