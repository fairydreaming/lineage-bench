So Randy is somewhere downstream of Roger, but we don't know exact position relative to others. Could be after Roger but before Willie? No, \"Roger is Willie's ancestor\" means Roger is before Willie. So order: Roger -> ... -> Willie. So Randy is descendant of Roger, could be after Willie or before Willie? Since descendant includes any later generation, Randy could be after Willie (i.e., further down) or could be between Roger and Willie? But if Randy were between Roger and Willie, then Randy would be ancestor of Willie, contradicting \"Roger is Willie's ancestor\" still holds (Roger ancestor of Willie). That's okay.

We need to deduce relationship between Randy and Helen.\n\nHelen is descendant of Gerald, which is descendant of Jean, which is descendant of Julie, which is descendant of Carl, which is descendant of Willie, which is descendant of Roger.

Not necessarily.\n\nWe need to see if any other relationship can be deduced: Is Randy ancestor of Helen? Could be if Randy is earlier in chain than Helen.
