We have ancestor/descendant statements. Let's define a directed graph: edge A -> B means A is ancestor of B (i.e., A precedes B). So \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X -> Y. \"X is Y's descendant\" means Y -> X (i.e., X is descendant of Y). Let's list statements:\n\n1. Kayla is Virginia's ancestor. => Kayla -> Virginia.\n2. Amanda is Jeremy's ancestor. => Amanda -> Jeremy.\n3. Susan is Kimberly's ancestor. => Susan -> Kimberly.\n4. Susan is Evelyn's descendant. => Evelyn -> Susan (since Susan is descendant of Evelyn, so Evelyn is ancestor of Susan). Wait: \"Susan is Evelyn's descendant\" means Susan is descendant of Evelyn, so Evelyn is ancestor of Susan. So Evelyn -> Susan.\n5. Paul is Kayla's ancestor. => Paul -> Kayla.\n6. Virginia is Amanda's ancestor. => Virginia -> Amanda.\n7. Paul is Kimberly's descendant. => Kimberly -> Paul (since Paul is descendant of Kimberly, so Kimberly is ancestor of Paul).

So Jeremy is descendant of Evelyn. The question: Determine the lineage relationship between Jeremy and Evelyn. Options:\n\n1. Jeremy is Evelyn's descendant. (Yes)\n2. Jeremy and Evelyn share a common descendant. (Not needed)\n3. Jeremy and Evelyn share a common ancestor. (They have many ancestors, but they are directly ancestor/descendant)\n4.
