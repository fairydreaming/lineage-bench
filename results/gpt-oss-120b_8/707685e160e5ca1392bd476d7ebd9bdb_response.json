Terms: ancestor vs descendant. If A is B's ancestor, then B is A's descendant. Let's list statements:\n\n1. Juan is Sean's ancestor. => Juan -> ancestor of Sean. So Sean is descendant of Juan.\n\n2. Joshua is Isabella's ancestor. => Joshua ancestor of Isabella. So Isabella descendant of Joshua.\n\n3. Dylan is Noah's descendant. => Dylan descendant of Noah. So Noah ancestor of Dylan.\n\n4. Noah is Sean's descendant. => Noah descendant of Sean. So Sean ancestor of Noah.\n\n5. Juan is Gabriel's descendant. => Juan descendant of Gabriel. So Gabriel ancestor of Juan.\n\n6. Gabriel is Nicole's descendant. => Gabriel descendant of Nicole. So Nicole ancestor of Gabriel.\n\n7. Isabella is Dylan's descendant. => Isabella descendant of Dylan. So Dylan ancestor of Isabella.\n\nWe need relationship between Joshua and Nicole.\n\nLet's build a family tree.\n\nWe have several individuals: Juan, Sean, Joshua, Isabella, Dylan, Noah, Gabriel, Nicole.\n\nLet's denote ancestor direction upward.\n\nFrom 1: Juan -> ancestor of Sean. So chain: Juan -> Sean (Juan older).\n\nFrom 4: Noah is Sean's descendant => Sean -> ancestor of Noah. So chain: Sean -> Noah.\n\nFrom 3: Dylan is Noah's descendant => Noah -> ancestor of Dylan. So chain: Noah -> Dylan.\n\nFrom 7: Isabella is Dylan's descendant => Dylan -> ancestor of Isabella. So chain: Dylan -> Isabella.\n\nFrom 2: Joshua is Isabella's ancestor => Joshua -> ancestor of Isabella. So chain: Joshua -> Isabella.\n\nThus we have a chain: Joshua -> Isabella <- Dylan <- Noah <- Sean <- Juan? Wait direction: Let's align.\n\nWe have: Joshua -> Isabella (Joshua ancestor of Isabella). Also Dylan -> Isabella (Dylan ancestor of Isabella). So both Joshua and Dylan are ancestors of Isabella. Could be that one is ancestor of the other? Not given.\n\nWe also have: Dylan is descendant of Noah (Noah ancestor of Dylan). So chain: Noah -> Dylan -> Isabella.\n\nNoah is descendant of Sean (Sean ancestor of Noah). So: Sean -> Noah -> Dylan -> Isabella.\n\nJuan is ancestor of Sean. So: Juan -> Sean -> Noah -> Dylan -> Isabella.\n\nNow other branch: Juan is descendant of Gabriel (Gabriel ancestor of Juan). So: Gabriel -> Juan -> Sean...\n\nGabriel is descendant of Nicole (Nicole ancestor of Gabriel). So: Nicole -> Gabriel -> Juan -> Sean...\n\nThus overall chain: Nicole -> Gabriel -> Juan -> Sean -> Noah -> Dylan -> Isabella.\n\nAnd also Joshua is ancestor of Isabella, but we don't know where Joshua fits relative to the chain. Could be above or below? Since Joshua is ancestor of Isabella, and we have a chain of ancestors leading to Isabella: ... -> Dylan -> Isabella. So Joshua could be somewhere above Dylan, or could be same as some earlier ancestor, or could be separate branch that also leads to Isabella (i.e., they converge). No info linking Joshua to other nodes except Isabella.\n\nThus we cannot determine direct relationship between Joshua and Nicole, except maybe they share a common descendant (Isabella) or common ancestor? Let's see.\n\nNicole is ancestor of Gabriel, etc. Joshua is ancestor of Isabella. Do they share a common descendant? Does any individual descend from both? Isabella is descendant of Joshua, but also descendant of Dylan, which is descendant of Sean, etc., which is descendant of Nicole? Wait is Isabella descendant of Nicole? Let's trace: Nicole -> Gabriel -> Juan -> Sean -> Noah -> Dylan -> Isabella. Yes, because we have a chain from Nicole down to Isabella. So Isabella is descendant of Nicole. Also Isabella is descendant of Joshua (by definition). So Isabella is a common descendant of both Joshua and Nicole. Therefore Joshua and Nicole share a common descendant (Isabella). That matches answer choice 3: \"Joshua and Nicole share a common descendant.\"\n\nCheck other options: 1 says share a common ancestor. Do they share a common ancestor? Possibly they share some ancestor above Nicole? Not given. So not certain.\n\n2 says Joshua is Nicole's descendant. Not true; Joshua is ancestor of Isabella, not descendant of Nicole (no link).
