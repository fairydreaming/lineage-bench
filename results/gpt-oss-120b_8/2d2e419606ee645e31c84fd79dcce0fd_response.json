We have statements:\n\n- Mason is Maria's ancestor. So Mason -> ancestor of Maria. Means Mason is older generation than Maria. So Mason -> Maria (Mason ancestor, Maria descendant).\n\n- Mason is Kelly's descendant. So Mason is descendant of Kelly. So Kelly -> ancestor of Mason.\n\nThus we have: Kelly ancestor -> Mason ancestor -> Maria descendant? Wait careful: Mason is Maria's ancestor, so Mason older than Maria. Also Mason is Kelly's descendant, so Kelly older than Mason. So chain: Kelly (oldest) -> Mason -> Maria (youngest). So Kelly -> Mason -> Maria.\n\n- Alice is Jerry's descendant. So Jerry ancestor -> Alice descendant.\n\n- Kelly is Joan's descendant. So Kelly is descendant of Joan. So Joan older than Kelly. So chain: Joan -> Kelly -> Mason -> Maria.\n\n- Joan is Lawrence's descendant. So Joan descendant of Lawrence. So Lawrence older than Joan. So chain: Lawrence -> Joan -> Kelly -> Mason -> Maria.\n\n- Maria is Jerry's ancestor. So Maria older than Jerry. So chain: ... Maria -> Jerry -> Alice (since Alice descendant of Jerry). So Maria older than Jerry older than Alice.\n\n- Christine is Lawrence's descendant. So Lawrence older than Christine.

Could be same generation as Joan, or later. No other constraints.\n\nThus relationship between Christine and Alice: Both are descendants of Lawrence. So they share a common ancestor (Lawrence). Also possibly Christine could be ancestor/descendant of Alice if more info, but not given. Since we only know Christine is descendant of Lawrence, and Alice is descendant of Lawrence via chain, they share a common ancestor (Lawrence). So answer 4.\n\nCheck other options: 1 says share a common descendant (i.e., they both have a descendant in common).
