Let's define ancestor/descendant direction: If X is Y's ancestor, then Y is X's descendant. So we have statements:\n\n1. Mason is Angela's descendant. => Mason descendant of Angela => Angela ancestor of Mason.\n\n2. Sandra is Joan's ancestor. => Sandra ancestor of Joan => Joan descendant of Sandra.\n\n3. Sharon is Diana's ancestor. => Sharon ancestor of Diana => Diana descendant of Sharon.\n\n4. Brittany is Sandra's ancestor. => Brittany ancestor of Sandra => Sandra descendant of Brittany.\n\n5. Joan is Sharon's ancestor. => Joan ancestor of Sharon => Sharon descendant of Joan.\n\n6. Christina is Diana's descendant. => Christina descendant of Diana => Diana ancestor of Christina.\n\n7. Christina is Mason's ancestor. => Christina ancestor of Mason => Mason descendant of Christina.\n\nWe need relationship between Angela and Brittany.\n\nLet's build a graph.\n\nWe'll treat ancestor relation as directed edge from ancestor to descendant.\n\nFrom 1: Angela -> Mason.\n\nFrom 2: Sandra -> Joan.\n\nFrom 3: Sharon -> Diana.\n\nFrom 4: Brittany -> Sandra.\n\nFrom 5: Joan -> Sharon.\n\nFrom 6: Diana -> Christina.\n\nFrom 7: Christina -> Mason.\n\nNow we can try to connect Angela and Brittany.\n\nWe have Angela -> Mason. Also Christina -> Mason, so Mason has two ancestors: Angela and Christina. That suggests Angela and Christina are both ancestors of Mason, but not necessarily related otherwise.\n\nWe have chain: Brittany -> Sandra -> Joan -> Sharon -> Diana -> Christina -> Mason.\n\nLet's verify: Brittany -> Sandra (from 4). Sandra -> Joan (2). Joan -> Sharon (5). Sharon -> Diana (3). Diana -> Christina (6). Christina -> Mason (7). So indeed there is a path from Brittany to Mason via those ancestors.\n\nThus Brittany is an ancestor of Mason (through multiple steps). Also Angela is an ancestor of Mason (direct). So both Angela and Brittany are ancestors of Mason. So they share a common descendant (Mason). The question: relationship between Angela and Brittany.\n\nWe have: Both are ancestors of Mason, but we need to see if one is ancestor of the other. Is there a path from Brittany to Angela or Angela to Brittany? Let's see.\n\nWe have Brittany -> ... -> Mason. Angela -> Mason. Does Angela appear in the chain from Brittany? Not directly. Could Angela be descendant of someone in that chain? Not given. No relation linking Angela to any of those nodes except Mason. So we cannot deduce that Angela is ancestor or descendant of Brittany. However they share a common descendant (Mason). So answer 4: Angela and Brittany share a common descendant.\n\nCheck other options: 1 says Angela is Brittany's descendant (i.e., Brittany ancestor of Angela). Not supported. 2 says share a common ancestor (they both descend from same person). Not given. 3 says Angela is Brittany's ancestor (Angela ancestor of Brittany). Not given. 4 matches our deduction.
