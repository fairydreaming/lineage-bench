Let's see if any chain links them.\n\nKayla -> Keith -> Jean -> Michelle -> Henry.\n\nGloria -> Ryan -> Rachel -> Henry.\n\nNo direct link between these two lines unless there is a connection via Henry? Both converge at Henry, but that doesn't make one ancestor of the other unless one is ancestor of the other's descendant? For example, if Kayla is ancestor of Henry, and Gloria is also ancestor of Henry, but neither is ancestor of the other (no path). So they share a common descendant (Henry).
