Let's define individuals: Danielle, Frances, Helen, Kimberly, Dylan, Madison, Sarah, Julia.\n\nRelationships given:\n\n1. Danielle is Frances's descendant. => Frances is ancestor of Danielle. So Frances -> ... -> Danielle.\n\n2. Helen is Danielle's ancestor. => Helen is ancestor of Danielle. So Helen -> ... -> Danielle.\n\n3. Kimberly is Dylan's ancestor. => Kimberly -> ... -> Dylan.\n\n4. Helen is Madison's descendant. => Madison is ancestor of Helen. So Madison -> ... -> Helen.\n\n5.

Also Frances is ancestor of Danielle (from 1). So Frances also ancestor of Danielle. Not sure relative order between Frances and Helen.\n\nAlso Sarah is ancestor of Frances (5). So Sarah -> Frances -> Danielle.\n\nAlso Dylan is ancestor of Sarah (7). So Dylan -> Sarah -> Frances -> Danielle.\n\nAlso Kimberly is ancestor of Dylan (3).

Julia's descendant chain includes Danielle as well. So Danielle is a common descendant of both Kimberly and Julia. That means Kimberly and Julia share a common descendant (Danielle).
