Joshua is Katherine's ancestor, so Katherine is a descendant of Joshua.\n\nIn the chain, Joshua is an ancestor of Katherine, and Judy is an ancestor of Joshua through the chain.\n\nSince Judy is an

Helen is Susan's ancestor.\n\nSusan is Ruth's ancestor (from 45), so Susan is Ruth's ancestor.\n\nJulie is Ruth's descendant (from 20), so Ruth is Julie's ancestor.\n\nDouglas is Julie's descendant (from 43), so Julie is Douglas's ancestor.\n\nDouglas is Shirley's ancestor (from 48), so Douglas is Shirley's ancestor.\n\nBradley is Shirley's descendant (from 60), so Shirley is Bradley's ancestor.\n\nBradley is Ashley's ancestor (from 53), so Bradley is Ashley's ancestor.\n\nAshley is Sandra's ancestor (from 38), so Ashley is Sandra's ancestor.\n\nSandra is Jordan's ancestor (from 24), so Sandra is Jordan's ancestor.\n\nJordan is Diane's ancestor (from 34), so Jordan is Diane's ancestor.\n\nKaren is Diane's descendant (from 25), so Diane is Karen's ancestor.\n\nKaren is Bryan's

ancestor (from 30), so Kenneth is Benjamin's ancestor.\n\nEthan is Benjamin's descendant (from 51), so Benjamin is Ethan's ancestor.\n\nPatrick is Ethan's descendant (from 8), so Ethan is Patrick's ancestor.\n\nJoshua is Patrick's descendant (from 27), so Patrick is Joshua's ancestor.\n\nKatherine is Joshua's descendant (from 13), so Joshua is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nTherefore, Judy is an ancestor of Anna, who is an ancestor of Nicholas, and so on, down to Joshua, who is an ancestor of Katherine. Thus, Judy is an ancestor of Katherine.\n\nSo, Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n1. Judy and Katherine share a common ancestor.\n\n2. Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\n3. Judy and Katherine share a common descendant.\n\n4. Judy is Katherine's descendant.\n\n5. None of the above.\n\nBased on this, option 2 seems correct: Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nBut is there any other relationship that might contradict or show something else?\n\nFor example, is there a path from Katherine back to Judy or something? But in this case, it seems direct.\n\nI should check if there's a common ancestor or descendant, but since Judy is directly an ancestor, it should be fine.\n\nOption 1 says they share a common ancestor, which would be true if Judy is an ancestor, but it's not the only possibility; they might share a common ancestor without Judy being the direct ancestor, but in this case, Judy is an ancestor, so they do share a common ancestor (Judy herself), but option 2 is more specific.\n\nThe question is to choose the correct relationship, and since Judy is Katherine's ancestor, option 2 is correct.\n\nBut let me make sure that all the connections are correct and I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor instance, in the chain, I have Anna as Judy's descendant, and then Anna as Nicholas's ancestor, etc.\n\nBut is there any loop or inconsistency?\n\nAlso, I recall that Anna is Judy's descendant, and Anna is also mentioned as Nicholas's ancestor, which is fine.\n\nAnother thing: in the list, there is \"Anna is Judy's descendant\" from 63, and that's the only direct link to Judy.\n\nSimilarly, Katherine is linked through Joshua.\n\nNow, I think I have a complete path.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if there's a shorter path or if I can confirm with another connection.\n\nFor example, is there a connection between Judy and Katherine through other means?\n\nBut I think this path is valid.\n\nPerhaps I can list the ancestors and descendants in a tree, but that might be messy.\n\nSince the chain is long, but each step is given, it should be fine.\n\nNow, one thing: in the options, there is \"share a common descendant\" or \"share a common ancestor\", but in this case, since Judy is an ancestor, Katherine is a descendant, so they share Judy as a common ancestor, and Katherine as a common descendant? No.\n\nIf Judy is an ancestor of Katherine, then Judy is an ancestor, Katherine is a descendant, so they share Judy as a common ancestor (for Katherine and Judy, but Judy is one of them), and they might share descendants, but Katherine is a descendant, so any descendant of Katherine would be a common descendant, but that's not necessary.\n\nSpecifically, for Judy and Katherine:\n\n- Judy is an ancestor of Katherine.\n\n- Therefore, Katherine is a descendant of Judy.\n\n- They share common ancestors: for example, Judy's ancestors, and also Judy herself if we consider, but typically, a person is not considered their own ancestor in this context, I think. In lineage, an ancestor is usually someone before you, not yourself.\n\nI need to clarify the terminology.\n\nIn genealogy, a person is not considered their own ancestor; ancestors are predecessors.\n\nSo, for Judy and Katherine, since Judy is an ancestor of Katherine, Judy is a common ancestor? No, Judy is an ancestor, but for Katherine, Judy is an ancestor, and for Judy, her ancestors are different.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nIf Judy is an ancestor of Katherine, that means Judy is a direct ancestor of Katherine.\n\nTherefore, Judy and Katherine share Judy as a common ancestor? No, Judy is not an ancestor of herself.\n\nFor example, if A is parent of B, then A is ancestor of B, and B is descendant of A.\n\nFor A and B, they share common ancestors only if there are people above both, but A is not a common ancestor; common ancestor means someone who is ancestor to both.\n\nIn this case, since Judy is ancestor of Katherine, Judy is an ancestor to Katherine, but not to herself. So the common ancestors would be the ancestors of Judy, who are also ancestors of Katherine.\n\nBut Judy herself is not a common ancestor; she is a direct ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, for descendants, Katherine is a descendant of Judy, so any descendant of Katherine is also a descendant of Judy, so they share common descendants.\n\nBut the point is, option 2 directly states that Judy is Katherine's ancestor, which is true.\n\nOption 1 says they share a common ancestor, which is also true because Judy's ancestors are ancestors of Katherine, since Judy is an ancestor.\n\nBut option 2 is more precise and directly given.\n\nThe question is to determine the relationship, and option 2 is correct.\n\nMoreover, in multiple choice, if 2 is true, and 1 might also be true, but 2 is specific.\n\nBut let's see the options; they are not mutually exclusive in all cases, but here, since Judy is ancestor, 2 is correct.\n\nOption 3: share a common descendant. Well, Katherine herself is a descendant of Judy, so any descendant of Katherine is a common descendant, but Katherine is not a descendant of herself, so they share descendants only if there are descendants of Katherine, but Katherine is a descendant, not a common descendant.\n\nA common descendant would be someone who is descendant of both Judy and Katherine.\n\nSince Katherine is descendant of Judy, any descendant of Katherine is also descendant of Judy, so they have common descendants.\n\nFor example, if Katherine has children, they are descendants of both.\n\nBut the relationship is between Judy and Katherine, not about others.\n\nThe options are about the relationship between them.\n\nOption 2 is direct: Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, option 4 would be if Katherine is ancestor of Judy, which is not the case.\n\nOption 5 is none.\n\nBut in this case, 2 seems correct.\n\nPerhaps I should check if there is any indication that Katherine is also an ancestor or something, but from the chain, no.\n\nAnother thing: in the list, there is \"Anna is Judy's descendant\" and \"Anna is Nicholas's ancestor\", etc., but I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can find if Judy and Katherine are connected through another path.\n\nFor example, is there a person who connects both?\n\nBut I think the path I have is sufficient.\n\nTo save time, since I have a clear path, I should go with it.\n\nSo, Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option 2.\n\nBut let me confirm the last part.\n\nFrom Joshua to Katherine: Katherine is Joshua's descendant, so Joshua is ancestor of Katherine.\n\nAnd Joshua is descendant of Patrick, and so on, back to Judy.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can write the chain backwards.\n\nStart from Katherine: Katherine is descendant of Joshua (13).\n\nJoshua is descendant of Patrick (27).\n\nPatrick is descendant of Ethan (8).\n\nEthan is descendant of Benjamin (51).\n\nBenjamin is descendant of Kenneth (30).\n\nKenneth is descendant of Terry (5).\n\nTerry is descendant of Nathan (54).\n\nNathan is descendant of Adam (3).\n\nAdam is descendant of Ronald (47).\n\nRonald is descendant of Donald (52).\n\nDonald is descendant of Carolyn (18).\n\nCarolyn is descendant of Bryan (26).\n\nBryan is descendant of Karen (22).\n\nKaren is descendant of Diane (25).\n\nDiane is descendant of Jordan (34).\n\nJordan is descendant of Sandra (24).\n\nSandra is descendant of Ashley (38).\n\nAshley is descendant of Bradley (53).\n\nBradley is descendant of Shirley (60).\n\nShirley is descendant of Douglas (48).\n\nDouglas is descendant of Julie (43).\n\nJulie is descendant of Ruth (20).\n\nRuth is descendant of Susan (45).\n\nSusan is descendant of Helen (7).\n\nHelen is descendant of Jacob (59).\n\nJacob is descendant of Walter (44).\n\nWalter is descendant of Kevin (35).\n\nKevin is descendant of Jesse (6).\n\nJesse is descendant of Rachel (39).\n\nRachel is descendant of Jacqueline (9).\n\nJacqueline is descendant of Scott (23).\n\nScott is descendant of Natalie (2).\n\nNatalie is descendant of Evelyn (58).\n\nEvelyn is descendant of Maria (50).\n\nMaria is descendant of Paul (61).\n\nPaul is descendant of Marilyn (41).\n\nMarilyn is descendant of Jennifer (62).\n\nJennifer is descendant of Steven (31).\n\nSteven is descendant of Ryan (21).\n\nRyan is descendant of Isabella (28).\n\nIsabella is descendant of Christian (1).\n\nChristian is descendant of Brittany (16).\n\nBrittany is descendant of Jack (14).\n\nJack is descendant of Willie (29).\n\nWillie is descendant of Betty (57).\n\nBetty is descendant of Melissa (36).\n\nMelissa is descendant of Carol (46).\n\nCarol is descendant of Harold (17).\n\nHarold is descendant of Janet (55).\n\nJanet is descendant of Michael (10).\n\nMichael is descendant of Jason (42).\n\nJason is descendant of Dorothy (4).\n\nDorothy is descendant of Andrea (32).\n\nAndrea is descendant of Alexis (37).\n\nAlexis is descendant of Frances (19).\n\nFrances is descendant of Arthur (40).\n\nArthur is descendant of Christine (12).\n\nChristine is descendant of Anthony (11).\n\nAnthony is descendant of Daniel (49).\n\nDaniel is descendant of Gerald (33).\n\nGerald is descendant of Nicholas (56).\n\nNicholas is descendant of Anna (15).\n\nAnna is descendant of Judy (63).\n\nTherefore, Katherine is descendant of Joshua, who is descendant of ... of Anna, who is descendant of Judy, so Katherine is descendant of Judy, meaning Judy is ancestor of Katherine.\n\nYes, confirmed.\n\nSo, Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option 2.","reasoning_details":[{"format":"unknown","index":0,"type":"reasoning.text","text":"\nI need to determine the lineage relationship between Judy and Katherine based on all these given relationships.

Marilyn is Jennifer's descendant.\n\n63. Anna is Judy's descendant.\n\nThe last one is key: Anna is Judy's descendant. That means Judy is Anna's ancestor. So Judy is an ancestor of Anna.\n\nNow, I need to find a connection to Katherine. Katherine is mentioned in relation 13: Katherine is Joshua's descendant, so Joshua is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nI need to see if there's a path from Anna to Katherine or something.\n\nSince Anna is Judy's descendant, if I can find that Anna is related to Katherine, that might help.\n\nLet me list all the people and see who is connected.\n\nFirst, from Anna: Anna is Judy's descendant, so Judy -> ... -> Anna.\n\nAlso, Anna is Nicholas's ancestor (from 15), so Anna -> ... -> Nicholas.\n\nAnd Nicholas is Gerald's ancestor (from 56), so Anna -> ... -> Nicholas -> ... -> Gerald.\n\nGerald is Daniel's ancestor (from 33), so Anna -> ... -> Nicholas -> ... -> Gerald -> ... -> Daniel.\n\nNow, Daniel is mentioned elsewhere.

Carolyn -> Donald -> Ronald -> Adam -> Nathan -> Terry -> Kenneth -> Benjamin -> Ethan -> Patrick -> Joshua -> Katherine.\n\nThat seems like a long path, but it connects Judy to Katherine through a series of ancestors and descendants.\n\nSpecifically, Judy is an ancestor of Anna, and Anna is an ancestor of Nicholas, and so on, down to Joshua, who is an ancestor of Katherine. Joshua is Katherine's ancestor, so Katherine is a descendant of Joshua.\n\nIn the chain, Joshua is an ancestor of Katherine, and Judy is an ancestor of Joshua through the chain.\n\nSince Judy is an ancestor of Anna, and Anna is an ancestor of all the way to Joshua, and Joshua is an ancestor of Katherine, that means Judy is an ancestor of Katherine.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me verify the directions.\n\nJudy is Anna's ancestor (from 63: Anna is Judy's descendant, so Judy is Anna's ancestor).\n\nAnna is Nicholas's ancestor (from 15).\n\nNicholas is Gerald's ancestor (from 56).\n\nGerald

ancestor.\n\nJacob is Walter's descendant (from 44), so Walter is Jacob's ancestor.\n\nHelen is Jacob's descendant (from 59), so Jacob is Helen's ancestor.\n\nSusan is Helen's descendant (from 7), so Helen is Susan's ancestor.\n\nSusan is Ruth's ancestor (from 45), so Susan is Ruth's ancestor.\n\nJulie is Ruth's descendant (from 20), so Ruth is Julie's ancestor.\n\nDouglas is Julie's descendant (from 43), so Julie is Douglas's ancestor.\n\nDouglas is Shirley's ancestor (from 48), so Douglas is Shirley's ancestor.\n\nBradley is Shirley's descendant (from 60), so Shirley is Bradley's ancestor.\n\nBradley is Ashley's ancestor (from 53), so Bradley is Ashley's ancestor.\n\nAshley is Sandra's ancestor (from 38), so Ashley is Sandra's ancestor.\n\nSandra is Jordan's ancestor (from

Adam is Nathan's ancestor.\n\nNathan is Terry's ancestor (from 54), so Nathan is Terry's ancestor.\n\nKenneth is Terry's descendant (from 5), so Terry is Kenneth's ancestor.\n\nKenneth is Benjamin's ancestor (from 30), so Kenneth is Benjamin's ancestor.\n\nEthan is Benjamin's descendant (from 51), so Benjamin is Ethan's ancestor.\n\nPatrick is Ethan's descendant (from 8), so Ethan is Patrick's ancestor.\n\nJoshua is Patrick's descendant (from 27), so Patrick is Joshua's ancestor.\n\nKatherine is Joshua's descendant (from 13), so Joshua is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nTherefore, Judy is an ancestor of Anna, who is an ancestor of Nicholas, and so on, down to Joshua, who is an ancestor of Katherine. Thus, Judy is an ancestor of Katherine.\n\nSo, Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n1. Judy and Katherine share a common ancestor.\n\n2. Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\n3. Judy and Katherine share a common descendant.\n\n4. Judy is Katherine's descendant.\n\n5. None of the above.\n\nBased on this, option 2 seems correct: Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nBut is there any other relationship that might contradict or show something else?\n\nFor example, is there a path from Katherine back to Judy or something? But in this case, it seems direct.\n\nI should check if there's a common ancestor or descendant, but since Judy is directly an ancestor, it should be fine.\n\nOption 1 says they share a common ancestor, which would be true if Judy is an ancestor, but it's not the only possibility; they might share a common ancestor without Judy being the direct ancestor, but in this case, Judy is an ancestor, so they do share a common ancestor (Judy herself), but option 2 is more specific.\n\nThe question is to choose the correct relationship, and since Judy is Katherine's ancestor, option 2 is correct.\n\nBut let me make sure that all the connections are correct and I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor instance, in the chain, I have Anna as Judy's descendant, and then Anna as Nicholas's ancestor, etc.\n\nBut is there any loop or inconsistency?\n\nAlso, I recall that Anna is Judy's descendant, and Anna is also mentioned as Nicholas's ancestor, which is fine.\n\nAnother thing: in the list, there is \"Anna is Judy's descendant\" from 63, and that's the only direct link to Judy.\n\nSimilarly, Katherine is linked through Joshua.\n\nNow, I think I have a complete path.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if there's a shorter path or if I can confirm with another connection.\n\nFor example, is there a connection between Judy and Katherine through other means?\n\nBut I think this path is valid.\n\nPerhaps I can list the ancestors and descendants in a tree, but that might be messy.\n\nSince the chain is long, but each step is given, it should be fine.\n\nNow, one thing: in the options, there is \"share a common descendant\" or \"share a common ancestor\", but in this case, since Judy is an ancestor, Katherine is a descendant, so they share Judy as a common ancestor, and Katherine as a common descendant? No.\n\nIf Judy is an ancestor of Katherine, then Judy is an ancestor, Katherine is a descendant, so they share Judy as a common ancestor (for Katherine and Judy, but Judy is one of them), and they might share descendants, but Katherine is a descendant, so any descendant of Katherine would be a common descendant, but that's not necessary.\n\nSpecifically, for Judy and Katherine:\n\n- Judy is an ancestor of Katherine.\n\n- Therefore, Katherine is a descendant of Judy.\n\n- They share common ancestors: for example, Judy's ancestors, and also Judy herself if we consider, but typically, a person is not considered their own ancestor in this context, I think. In lineage, an ancestor is usually someone before you, not yourself.\n\nI need to clarify the terminology.\n\nIn genealogy, a person is not considered their own ancestor; ancestors are predecessors.\n\nSo, for Judy and Katherine, since Judy is an ancestor of Katherine, Judy is a common ancestor? No, Judy is an ancestor, but for Katherine, Judy is an ancestor, and for Judy, her ancestors are different.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nIf Judy is an ancestor of Katherine, that means Judy is a direct ancestor of Katherine.\n\nTherefore, Judy and Katherine share Judy as a common ancestor? No, Judy is not an ancestor of herself.\n\nFor example, if A is parent of B, then A is ancestor of B, and B is descendant of A.\n\nFor A and B, they share common ancestors only if there are people above both, but A is not a common ancestor; common ancestor means someone who is ancestor to both.\n\nIn this case, since Judy is ancestor of Katherine, Judy is an ancestor to Katherine, but not to herself. So the common ancestors would be the ancestors of Judy, who are also ancestors of Katherine.\n\nBut Judy herself is not a common ancestor; she is a direct ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, for descendants, Katherine is a descendant of Judy, so any descendant of Katherine is also a descendant of Judy, so they share common descendants.\n\nBut the point is, option 2 directly states that Judy is Katherine's ancestor, which is true.\n\nOption 1 says they share a common ancestor, which is also true because Judy's ancestors are ancestors of Katherine, since Judy is an ancestor.\n\nBut option 2 is more precise and directly given.\n\nThe question is to determine the relationship, and option 2 is correct.\n\nMoreover, in multiple choice, if 2 is true, and 1 might also be true, but 2 is specific.\n\nBut let's see the options; they are not mutually exclusive in all cases, but here, since Judy is ancestor, 2 is correct.\n\nOption 3: share a common descendant. Well, Katherine herself is a descendant of Judy, so any descendant of Katherine is a common descendant, but Katherine is not a descendant of herself, so they share descendants only if there are descendants of Katherine, but Katherine is a descendant, not a common descendant.\n\nA common descendant would be someone who is descendant of both Judy and Katherine.\n\nSince Katherine is descendant of Judy, any descendant of Katherine is also descendant of Judy, so they have common descendants.\n\nFor example, if Katherine has children, they are descendants of both.\n\nBut the relationship is between Judy and Katherine, not about others.\n\nThe options are about the relationship between them.\n\nOption 2 is direct: Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, option 4 would be if Katherine is ancestor of Judy, which is not the case.\n\nOption 5 is none.\n\nBut in this case, 2 seems correct.\n\nPerhaps I should check if there is any indication that Katherine is also an ancestor or something, but from the chain, no.\n\nAnother thing: in the list, there is \"Anna is Judy's descendant\" and \"Anna is Nicholas's ancestor\", etc., but I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can find if Judy and Katherine are connected through another path.\n\nFor example, is there a person who connects both?\n\nBut I think the path I have is sufficient.\n\nTo save time, since I have a clear path, I should go with it.\n\nSo, Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option 2.\n\nBut let me confirm the last part.\n\nFrom Joshua to Katherine: Katherine is Joshua's descendant, so Joshua is ancestor of Katherine.\n\nAnd Joshua is descendant of Patrick, and so on, back to Judy.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can write the chain backwards.\n\nStart from Katherine: Katherine is descendant of Joshua (13).\n\nJoshua is descendant of Patrick (27).\n\nPatrick is descendant of Ethan (8).\n\nEthan is descendant of Benjamin (51).\n\nBenjamin is descendant of Kenneth (30).\n\nKenneth is descendant of Terry (5).\n\nTerry is descendant of Nathan (54).\n\nNathan is descendant of Adam (3).\n\nAdam is descendant of Ronald (47).\n\nRonald is descendant of Donald (52).\n\nDonald is descendant of Carolyn (18).\n\nCarolyn is descendant of Bryan (26).\n\nBryan is descendant of Karen (22).\n\nKaren is descendant of Diane (25).\n\nDiane is descendant of Jordan (34).\n\nJordan is descendant of Sandra (24).\n\nSandra is descendant of Ashley (38).\n\nAshley is descendant of Bradley (53).\n\nBradley is descendant of Shirley (60).\n\nShirley is descendant of Douglas (48).\n\nDouglas is descendant of Julie (43).\n\nJulie is descendant of Ruth (20).\n\nRuth is descendant of Susan (45).\n\nSusan is descendant of Helen (7).\n\nHelen is descendant of Jacob (59).\n\nJacob is descendant of Walter (44).\n\nWalter is descendant of Kevin (35).\n\nKevin is descendant of Jesse (6).\n\nJesse is descendant of Rachel (39).\n\nRachel is descendant of Jacqueline (9).\n\nJacqueline is descendant of Scott (23).\n\nScott is descendant of Natalie (2).\n\nNatalie is descendant of Evelyn (58).\n\nEvelyn is descendant of Maria (50).\n\nMaria is descendant of Paul (61).\n\nPaul is descendant of Marilyn (41).\n\nMarilyn is descendant of Jennifer (62).\n\nJennifer is descendant of Steven (31).\n\nSteven is descendant of Ryan (21).\n\nRyan is descendant of Isabella (28).\n\nIsabella is descendant of Christian (1).\n\nChristian is descendant of Brittany (16).\n\nBrittany is descendant of Jack (14).\n\nJack is descendant of Willie (29).\n\nWillie is descendant of Betty (57).\n\nBetty is descendant of Melissa (36).\n\nMelissa is descendant of Carol (46).\n\nCarol is descendant of Harold (17).\n\nHarold is descendant of Janet (55).\n\nJanet is descendant of Michael (10).\n\nMichael is descendant of Jason (42).\n\nJason is descendant of Dorothy (4).\n\nDorothy is descendant of Andrea (32).\n\nAndrea is descendant of Alexis (37).\n\nAlexis is descendant of Frances (19).\n\nFrances is descendant of Arthur (40).\n\nArthur is descendant of Christine (12).\n\nChristine is descendant of Anthony (11).\n\nAnthony is descendant of Daniel (49).\n\nDaniel is descendant of Gerald (33).\n\nGerald is descendant of Nicholas (56).\n\nNicholas is descendant of Anna (15).\n\nAnna is descendant of Judy (63).\n\nTherefore, Katherine is descendant of Joshua, who is descendant of ... of Anna, who is descendant of Judy, so Katherine is descendant of Judy, meaning Judy is ancestor of Katherine.\n\nYes, confirmed.\n\nSo, Judy is Katherine's ancestor.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option 2."}]}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":540,"completion_tokens":6261,"total_tokens":6801,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":11}}}
