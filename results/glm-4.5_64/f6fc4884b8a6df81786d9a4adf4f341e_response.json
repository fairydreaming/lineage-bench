From 60: Denise is Patricia's descendant, so Patricia is ancestor of Denise.\n\nPatricia is ancestor of Mason.\n\nMason is ancestor of Diana? Diana is Mason's descendant, so Mason is ancestor of Diana.\n\nDiana is descendant of Amy? Amy is Diana's ancestor, so Amy is ancestor of Diana.\n\nAmy is ancestor of Gabriel.\n\nGabriel is ancestor of Dorothy.\n\nDorothy is ancestor of Andrea.\n\nSo, Andrea is a descendant of Dorothy, who is a descendant of Gabriel, and so on, up to Elijah.\n\nTherefore, Andrea is a descendant of Elijah.\n\nBut Andrea is also an ancestor of Brandon.\n\nSo, Elijah is an ancestor of Andrea, who is an ancestor of Brandon.\n\nTherefore, Elijah is an ancestor of Brandon.\n\nIn other words, Brandon is a descendant of Elijah.\n\nNow, to confirm, let's see the direct path.\n\nFrom Elijah to Andrea:\n\nElijah → Harold → Michael → Bobby → Philip → Ralph → Karen → Denise → Patricia → Mason → Diana → Amy → Gabriel → Dorothy → Andrea.\n\nThen from Andrea to Brandon:\n\nAndrea → Mary → Kathleen → Brian → Madison → Pamela → Kevin → William → Tyler → Carl → Danielle → Brenda → Heather → Jerry → Ruth → Mark → Logan → George → Vincent → Margaret → Zachary → Kelly → Jennifer → Richard → Bryan → Ryan → Christine → Janice → Stephen → Charles → Melissa → Jeffrey → Abigail → Albert → Sandra → Rachel → Justin → Teresa → Janet → Arthur → Amanda → Lawrence → Alice → Megan → Alan → Cynthia → Samantha → Beverly → Robert → Brandon.\n\nSo yes, Elijah is an ancestor of Brandon.\n\nTherefore, Brandon is Elijah's descendant.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n1. Brandon and Elijah share a common descendant.\n\n2. Brandon and Elijah share a common ancestor.\n\n3. Brandon is Elijah's descendant.\n\n4. Brandon is Elijah's ancestor.\n\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nSince Brandon is Elijah's descendant, option 3 is correct.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no mistakes.\n\nIs there any possibility that they are the same person or something? No, from the names, they are different.\n\nAlso, in the path, all relationships are given, so it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I can check if there is a shorter path or if I missed something.\n\nFor example, is there a direct connection?\n\nFrom Elijah to Andrea, and Andrea to Brandon, as above.\n\nSince Andrea is common, and Elijah is ancestor of Andrea, Andrea is ancestor of Brandon, so Elijah is ancestor of Brandon.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's see if they share a common descendant or ancestor.\n\nThey share a common ancestor? Well, Elijah is an ancestor of Brandon, so any ancestor of Elijah is also an ancestor of Brandon, but that's not sharing a common ancestor in the sense of both being descendants of someone.\n\nOption 2 says \"share a common ancestor\", which means there is someone who is an ancestor of both.\n\nBut in this case, since Elijah is an ancestor of Brandon, any ancestor of Elijah is also an ancestor of Brandon, so yes, they share common ancestors, for example, Elijah himself is an ancestor of both? No, Elijah is an ancestor of Brandon, but not of himself in the lineage sense, but typically, a person is considered their own ancestor? No, in genealogy, a person is not considered their own ancestor; ancestors are predecessors.\n\nSo, for example, Elijah's ancestors are also ancestors of Brandon, since Brandon is a descendant of Elijah.\n\nSo, yes, they share common ancestors, like Elijah's parents, etc., but we don't have that information, but in principle, they do share common ancestors.\n\nBut the question is to select the correct answer, and option 3 is directly correct.\n\nOption 1: share a common descendant. That would mean there is someone who is a descendant of both Brandon and Elijah.\n\nBut since Brandon is a descendant of Elijah, any descendant of Brandon is also a descendant of Elijah, so yes, they share common descendants, for example, Brandon's descendants.\n\nBut again, option 3 is more direct and correct.\n\nThe question is to determine the relationship, and since Brandon is directly a descendant of Elijah, option 3 is correct.\n\nMoreover, in multiple choice, sometimes only one is correct, but here option 3 is clearly correct, and option 2 might also be true, but since the question likely expects the most direct relationship, and option 3 is listed, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me see the options: it says \"select the correct answer\", and probably only one is intended, but technically both 2 and 3 could be argued, but 3 is more precise.\n\nOption 2: \"share a common ancestor\" – this is true, as they have common ancestors, but it doesn't specify that one is ancestor of the other.\n\nSimilarly, option 1 is also true, but less direct.\n\nBut the relationship is that Brandon is descendant of Elijah, so option 3 directly states that.\n\nMoreover, in the context, since we found a direct path, option 3 is correct.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if there is any contradiction.\n\nFor example, is Elijah related to Brandon in another way? Probably not, but in this case, it's clear.\n\nPerhaps I should check if the path is correct.\n\nLet me verify a few links.\n\nFrom Elijah to Harold: Elijah is Harold's ancestor (24).\n\nHarold to

From 60: Denise is Patricia's descendant, so Patricia is ancestor of Denise.\n\nPatricia is ancestor of Mason.\n\nMason is ancestor of Diana? Diana is Mason's descendant, so Mason is ancestor of Diana.\n\nDiana is descendant of Amy? Amy is Diana's ancestor, so Amy is ancestor of Diana.\n\nAmy is ancestor of Gabriel.\n\nGabriel is ancestor of Dorothy.\n\nDorothy is ancestor of Andrea.\n\nSo, Andrea is a descendant of Dorothy, who is a descendant of Gabriel, and so on, up to Elijah.\n\nTherefore, Andrea is a descendant of Elijah.\n\nBut Andrea is also an ancestor of Brandon.\n\nSo, Elijah is an ancestor of Andrea, who is an ancestor of Brandon.\n\nTherefore, Elijah is an ancestor of Brandon.\n\nIn other words, Brandon is a descendant of Elijah.\n\nNow, to confirm, let's see the direct path.\n\nFrom Elijah to Andrea:\n\nElijah → Harold → Michael → Bobby → Philip → Ralph → Karen → Denise → Patricia → Mason → Diana → Amy → Gabriel → Dorothy → Andrea.\n\nThen from Andrea to Brandon:\n\nAndrea → Mary → Kathleen → Brian → Madison → Pamela → Kevin → William → Tyler → Carl → Danielle → Brenda → Heather → Jerry → Ruth → Mark → Logan → George → Vincent → Margaret → Zachary → Kelly → Jennifer → Richard → Bryan → Ryan → Christine → Janice → Stephen → Charles → Melissa → Jeffrey → Abigail → Albert → Sandra → Rachel → Justin → Teresa → Janet → Arthur → Amanda → Lawrence → Alice → Megan → Alan → Cynthia → Samantha → Beverly → Robert → Brandon.\n\nSo yes, Elijah is an ancestor of Brandon.\n\nTherefore, Brandon is Elijah's descendant.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n1. Brandon and Elijah share a common descendant.\n\n2. Brandon and Elijah share a common ancestor.\n\n3. Brandon is Elijah's descendant.\n\n4. Brandon is Elijah's ancestor.\n\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nSince Brandon is Elijah's descendant, option 3 is correct.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no mistakes.\n\nIs there any possibility that they are the same person or something? No, from the names, they are different.\n\nAlso, in the path, all relationships are given, so it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I can check if there is a shorter path or if I missed something.\n\nFor example, is there a direct connection?\n\nFrom Elijah to Andrea, and Andrea to Brandon, as above.\n\nSince Andrea is common, and Elijah is ancestor of Andrea, Andrea is ancestor of Brandon, so Elijah is ancestor of Brandon.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's see if they share a common descendant or ancestor.\n\nThey share a common ancestor? Well, Elijah is an ancestor of Brandon, so any ancestor of Elijah is also an ancestor of Brandon, but that's not sharing a common ancestor in the sense of both being descendants of someone.\n\nOption 2 says \"share a common ancestor\", which means there is someone who is an ancestor of both.\n\nBut in this case, since Elijah is an ancestor of Brandon, any ancestor of Elijah is also an ancestor of Brandon, so yes, they share common ancestors, for example, Elijah himself is an ancestor of both? No, Elijah is an ancestor of Brandon, but not of himself in the lineage sense, but typically, a person is considered their own ancestor? No, in genealogy, a person is not considered their own ancestor; ancestors are predecessors.\n\nSo, for example, Elijah's ancestors are also ancestors of Brandon, since Brandon is a descendant of Elijah.\n\nSo, yes, they share common ancestors, like Elijah's parents, etc., but we don't have that information, but in principle, they do share common ancestors.\n\nBut the question is to select the correct answer, and option 3 is directly correct.\n\nOption 1: share a common descendant. That would mean there is someone who is a descendant of both Brandon and Elijah.\n\nBut since Brandon is a descendant of Elijah, any descendant of Brandon is also a descendant of Elijah, so yes, they share common descendants, for example, Brandon's descendants.\n\nBut again, option 3 is more direct and correct.\n\nThe question is to determine the relationship, and since Brandon is directly a descendant of Elijah, option 3 is correct.\n\nMoreover, in multiple choice, sometimes only one is correct, but here option 3 is clearly correct, and option 2 might also be true, but since the question likely expects the most direct relationship, and option 3 is listed, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me see the options: it says \"select the correct answer\", and probably only one is intended, but technically both 2 and 3 could be argued, but 3 is more precise.\n\nOption 2: \"share a common ancestor\" – this is true, as they have common ancestors, but it doesn't specify that one is ancestor of the other.\n\nSimilarly, option 1 is also true, but less direct.\n\nBut the relationship is that Brandon is descendant of Elijah, so option 3 directly states that.\n\nMoreover, in the context, since we found a direct path, option 3 is correct.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if there is any contradiction.\n\nFor example, is Elijah related to Brandon in another way? Probably not, but in this case, it's clear.\n\nPerhaps I should check if the path is correct.\n\nLet me verify a few links.\n\nFrom Elijah to Harold: Elijah is Harold's ancestor (24).\n\nHarold to
