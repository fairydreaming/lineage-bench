Analysis of the relationship:**\n*   Kayla is at the beginning of this chain.\n*   Matthew is at the end of this chain.\n*   The chain flows from Kayla to Matthew.\n*   This means Kayla is an ancestor of Matthew.\n*   Or, Matthew is a descendant of Kayla.\n\n**27. Let's check the options:**\n1.  Kayla and Matthew share a common ancestor. (Incorrect, Kayla is an ancestor of Matthew).\n2.  Kayla and Matthew share a common descendant. (Incorrect, Matthew is a descendant of Kayla, but Kayla is not a descendant of Matthew, so they don't share a common descendant in the sense of two separate lines converging).\n3.  Kayla is Matthew's descendant. (Incorrect, it's the other way around).\n4.  Kayla is Matthew's ancestor. (Correct).\n5.  None of the above is correct. (Incorrect, option 4 is correct).\n\n**28.
