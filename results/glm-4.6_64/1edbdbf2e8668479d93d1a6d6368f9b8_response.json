The list says: \"Eugene is Kevin's descendant\" and \"Eugene is Barbara's ancestor\". So, Barbara's ancestor is Eugene.\n* Eugene's ancestors? The list says \"Amber is Kevin's ancestor\" and \"Eugene is Kevin's descendant\". So, Amber is Eugene's ancestor.\n* Amber's ancestors? The list says \"Amber is Debra's descendant\". So, Debra is Amber's ancestor.\n* Debra's ancestors? The list says \"Debra is Jeremy's descendant\". So, Jeremy is Debra's ancestor.\n* Jeremy's ancestors?

So, Rebecca is Doris's ancestor.\n* Rebecca's ancestors? The list says \"Justin is Rebecca's ancestor\". So, Justin is Rebecca's ancestor.\n* Justin's ancestors?

So, Gregory is Steven's ancestor.\n* Gregory's ancestors? The list says \"Gregory is Nancy's descendant\". So, Nancy is Gregory's ancestor.\n* Nancy's ancestors? The list says \"Nancy is Gerald's descendant\". So, Gerald is Nancy's ancestor.\n* Gerald's ancestors? The list says \"Jessica is Gerald's ancestor\". So, Jessica is Gerald's ancestor.\n* Jessica's ancestors? The list says \"Jessica is Jordan's descendant\". So, Jordan is Jessica's ancestor.\n* Jordan's ancestors? The list says \"Jordan is Deborah's ancestor\". This is a dead end for tracing *up* from Arthur. Let's re-read. \"Jordan is Deborah's ancestor\" means Deborah is Jordan's descendant. This doesn't help me trace Jordan's ancestors.\n\nLet's re-start Arthur's lineage from the top and see if there are any other connections.\n* Arthur -> Barbara (Arthur is Barbara's descendant)\n* Barbara <- Eugene (Eugene is Barbara's ancestor)\n* Eugene <- Amber (Amber is Kevin's ancestor; Eugene is Kevin's descendant.

So, Judith is Beverly's ancestor.\n* Judith's ancestors? The list says \"Jacqueline is Judith's ancestor\". So, Jacqueline is Judith's ancestor.\n* Jacqueline's ancestors? The list says \"Lisa is Jacqueline's ancestor\". So, Lisa is Jacqueline's ancestor.\n* Lisa's ancestors? The list says \"Lisa is Kelly's descendant\". So, Kelly is Lisa's ancestor.\n* Kelly's ancestors? The list says \"Kelly is Betty's descendant\". So, Betty is Kelly's ancestor.\n* Betty's ancestors? The list says \"Alan is Betty's ancestor\". So, Alan is Betty's ancestor.\n* Alan's ancestors? The list says \"Alan is Marilyn's descendant\". So, Marilyn is Alan's ancestor.\n* Marilyn's ancestors? The list says \"Juan is Marilyn's ancestor\". So, Juan is Marilyn's ancestor.\n* Juan's ancestors? The list says \"Patricia is Juan's ancestor\". So, Patricia is Juan's ancestor.\n* Patricia's ancestors? The list says \"Patricia is Robert's descendant\". So, Robert is Patricia's ancestor.\n* Robert's ancestors?

The list says \"Tyler is Lauren's descendant\". So, Lauren is Tyler's ancestor.\n* Lauren's ancestors? The list says \"Lauren is Julie's descendant\". So, Julie is Lauren's ancestor.\n* Julie's ancestors? The list says \"Isabella is Julie's ancestor\". So, Isabella is Julie's ancestor.\n* Isabella's ancestors?

So, Joshua is Mason's ancestor.\n* Joshua's ancestors? The list says \"Deborah is Joshua's ancestor\". So, Deborah is Joshua's ancestor.\n\nSo, Mary's ancestor chain is: Mary <- Carl <- Russell <- Logan <- Diana <- Dorothy <- Marie <- Gabriel <- Frank <- Bruce <- Melissa <- Aaron <- Joe <- Beverly <- Judith <- Jacqueline <- Lisa <- Kelly <- Betty <- Alan <- Marilyn <- Juan <- Patricia <- Robert <- Grace <- Jonathan <- Edward <- Emily <- Tyler <- Lauren <- Julie <- Isabella <- Joan <- Walter <- Christian <- Mason <- Joshua <- Deborah.\n\n**4. Compare the two lineages to find a connection.**\n\n*   **Arthur's chain:** Arthur <- Barbara <- Eugene <- Amber <- Debra <- Jeremy <- Janet <- Shirley <- Alexander <- Kathryn <- Bradley <- Charlotte <- Stephen <- Austin <- Jesse <- Doris <- Rebecca <- Justin <- Steven <- Gregory <- Nancy <- Gerald <- Jessica <- Jordan -> Deborah\n*   **Mary's chain:** Mary <- Carl <- Russell <- Logan <- Diana <- Dorothy <- Marie <- Gabriel <- Frank <- Bruce <- Melissa <- Aaron <- Joe <- Beverly <- Judith <- Jacqueline <- Lisa <- Kelly <- Betty <- Alan <- Marilyn <- Juan <- Patricia <- Robert <- Grace <- Jonathan <- Edward <- Emily <- Tyler <- Lauren <- Julie <- Isabella <- Joan <- Walter <- Christian <- Mason <- Joshua <- Deborah\n\n**5. Analyze the connection.**\nBoth chains end at Deborah.\nIn Arthur's chain: Jordan is Deborah's ancestor. This means Deborah is Jordan's descendant.\nIn Mary's chain: Deborah is Joshua's ancestor. This means Joshua is Deborah's descendant.\n\nWait, let's re-read the connection for Arthur.\nArthur's chain: ... Jordan -> Deborah\nThis means \"Jordan is Deborah's ancestor\".\nSo, Jordan is an ancestor of Deborah.\n\nMary's chain: ... Joshua <- Deborah\nThis means \"Deborah is Joshua's ancestor\".\nSo, Deborah is an ancestor of Joshua.\n\nThis doesn't seem right. Let me re-trace the last steps.\n\n**Arthur's chain (re-trace):**\n...\n* Jessica is Jordan's descendant. (Jordan is Jessica's ancestor)\n* Jordan is Deborah's ancestor. (Deborah is Jordan's descendant)\n\nSo, Arthur is a descendant of Jordan, and Jordan is an ancestor of Deborah. This makes Arthur a descendant of Deborah. Let's write that out.\nArthur <- Barbara <- Eugene <- Amber <- Debra <- Jeremy <- Janet <- Shirley <- Alexander <- Kathryn <- Bradley <- Charlotte <- Stephen <- Austin <- Jesse <- Doris <- Rebecca <- Justin <- Steven <- Gregory <- Nancy <- Gerald <- Jessica <- Jordan -> Deborah.\nThis is incorrect.\nLet's fix the arrows.\n`X is Y's descendant` means `X <- Y`.\n`X is Y's ancestor` means `X -> Y`.\n\n**Arthur's Lineage (going down from ancestors):**\n* Barbara is Arthur's ancestor.

So, Jessica is Gerald's ancestor.\n* Jessica's ancestors? The list says \"Jessica is Jordan's descendant\". So, Jordan is Jessica's ancestor.\n* Jordan's ancestors? The list says \"Jordan is Deborah's ancestor\". This is a dead end for tracing *up* from Arthur. Let's re-read. \"Jordan is Deborah's ancestor\" means Deborah is Jordan's descendant.

Analyze the connection.**\nBoth chains end at Deborah.\nIn Arthur's chain: Jordan is Deborah's ancestor. This means Deborah is Jordan's descendant.\nIn Mary's chain: Deborah is Joshua's ancestor.
