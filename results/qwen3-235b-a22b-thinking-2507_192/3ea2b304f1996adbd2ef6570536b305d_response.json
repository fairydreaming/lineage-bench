is Eugene's ancestor, so Robert → Eugene.\n\nThis chain establishes that Jesse is an ancestor of Eugene through multiple generations. Therefore, Jesse is Eugene's ancestor, corresponding to option 1.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n- Option 2 is false because Jesse is not a descendant of Eugene; the lineage flows from Jesse to Eugene.\n- Option 3 is less specific; while Jesse and Eugene share common ancestors (all ancestors of Jesse), the direct relationship makes option 1 more accurate.\n- Option 4 is not supported, as there is no indication they share a common descendant in the given relationships.\n- Option 5 is unnecessary since option 1 is correct.\n\n<ANSWER>1</ANSWER>","refusal":null,"reasoning":"\nI need to determine the lineage relationship between Jesse and Eugene. The options are:\n\n1. Jesse is Eugene's ancestor.\n\n2. Jesse is Eugene's descendant.\n\n3. Jesse and Eugene share a common ancestor.\n\n4. Jesse and Eugene share a common descendant.\n\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nFirst, I should map out all the relationships given. There are many, so I'll need to organize them into a family tree or at least find connections between Jesse and Eugene.\n\nLet me list all the relationships that might connect to Jesse or Eugene.\n\nJesse is mentioned in: \"Jesse is Joshua's ancestor.\"\n\nEugene is mentioned in: \"Robert is Eugene's ancestor.\"\n\nSo, Robert is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from Jesse to Eugene or vice versa.\n\nSince it's a lineage, I should look for common ancestors or descendants.\n\nOption 3 is about sharing a common ancestor, which might be the case if they are cousins or something, but lineage here seems direct, like parent-child, but it says \"ancestor\" and \"descendant,\" so it could be multiple generations.\n\nThe relationships are given as direct ancestor-descendant pairs, but since it's \"ancestor,\" it could be grandparent or further.\n\nSimilarly for descendant.\n\nBut for Jesse and Eugene, I need to see if one is directly related or if they share a common point.\n\nFirst, let's find who Jesse is connected to.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- Jesse is Joshua's ancestor.\n\nAlso, Joshua is mentioned elsewhere? Let me see.\n\n\"Jesse is Joshua's ancestor.\"\n\nAnd \"Terry is Joshua's descendant.\" But Terry is a descendant, so Joshua is an ancestor of Terry? No.\n\n\"Terry is Joshua's descendant\" means Joshua is an ancestor of Terry.\n\nSimilarly, \"Jesse is Joshua's ancestor\" means Jesse is an ancestor of Joshua.\n\nSo Jesse → Joshua → ... → Terry, but Terry might not be directly related to Eugene.\n\nI need to find a chain.\n\nSimilarly, Eugene: Robert is Eugene's ancestor, so Robert → Eugene.\n\nNow, Robert is also mentioned: \"Robert is Charlotte's descendant.\" and \"Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor.\"\n\nLet's list all connections involving Robert or Eugene.\n\nEugene: only \"Robert is Eugene's ancestor\" so far.\n\nRobert: \"Robert is Eugene's ancestor\" and \"Robert is Charlotte's descendant.\"\n\nAlso, \"Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor\" from \"Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor.\"\n\nLet's find Charlotte.\n\n\"Robert is Charlotte's descendant\" so Charlotte is an ancestor of Robert.\n\nAnd \"Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor\" so Evelyn is an ancestor of Charlotte.\n\nTherefore, Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nSo Evelyn is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nNow, Jesse: \"Jesse is Joshua's ancestor.\"\n\nWho is Joshua connected to?\n\n\"Terry is Joshua's descendant\" so Joshua is an ancestor of Terry.\n\nAlso, \"Jesse is Joshua's ancestor\" so Jesse → Joshua → Terry.\n\nBut Terry might connect to others.\n\n\"Terry is Alan's ancestor\" from \"Terry is Alan's ancestor.\"\n\nAnd \"Abigail is Alan's descendant\" so Alan is an ancestor of Abigail.\n\nAlso, \"Virginia is Abigail's descendant\" so Abigail is an ancestor of Virginia.\n\nThis is getting messy. I need to find a common link.\n\nPerhaps I should look for people who connect to both sides.\n\nAnother idea: maybe Eugene and Jesse are related through multiple paths.\n\nLet me list all the relationships in a graph or something.\n\nSince it's text, I can group by names.\n\nFirst, let's find all ancestors and descendants for key people.\n\nStart with Eugene.\n\nEugene has Robert as ancestor.\n\nRobert has Charlotte as ancestor (since Robert is Charlotte's descendant, so Charlotte is ancestor of Robert).\n\nCharlotte has Evelyn as ancestor (Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor).\n\nSo Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nNow, Evelyn: who is Evelyn's ancestor?\n\n\"Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor\" but that's for Charlotte, not for Evelyn.\n\nIs there anyone who is Evelyn's ancestor?\n\nLet's see: \"Steven is Evelyn's ancestor\" from \"Steven is Evelyn's ancestor.\"\n\nYes: \"Steven is Evelyn's ancestor.\"\n\nSo Steven → Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nNow, Steven: who is Steven's ancestor?\n\n\"Kenneth is Steven's ancestor\" from \"Kenneth is Steven's ancestor.\"\n\nAnd \"Theresa is Kenneth's ancestor\" from \"Theresa is Kenneth's ancestor.\"\n\nSo Theresa → Kenneth → Steven → Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nNow, Theresa: is there more? \"Theresa is Ann's descendant\" from \"Theresa is Ann's descendant.\"\n\n\"Theresa is Ann's descendant\" means Ann is ancestor of Theresa.\n\nSo Ann → Theresa → Kenneth → Steven → Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nBut Ann might have ancestors.\n\n\"Ann is Diane's descendant\" from \"Ann is Diane's descendant,\" so Diane is ancestor of Ann.\n\nDiane: \"Diane is Juan's descendant\" so Juan is ancestor of Diane.\n\nJuan: \"Juan is Vincent's descendant\" so Vincent is ancestor of Juan.\n\nVincent: \"Vincent is Jordan's descendant\" so Jordan is ancestor of Vincent.\n\nJordan: \"Jordan is Jacqueline's descendant\" from \"Jordan is Jacqueline's descendant.\"\n\nAnd \"Raymond is Jacqueline's ancestor\" from \"Raymond is Jacqueline's ancestor.\"\n\nAlso, \"Raymond is Elizabeth's descendant\" from \"Raymond is Elizabeth's descendant.\"\n\nThis is branching a lot.\n\nI should focus on Jesse now.\n\nJesse: \"Jesse is Joshua's ancestor.\"\n\nJoshua: \"Terry is Joshua's descendant\" so Joshua is ancestor of Terry.\n\nTerry: \"Terry is Alan's ancestor\" so Terry → Alan.\n\nAlan: \"Abigail is Alan's descendant\" so Alan → Abigail.\n\nAbigail: \"Virginia is Abigail's descendant\" so Abigail → Virginia.\n\nVirginia: \"Virginia is Bradley's ancestor\" from

Jesse to Eugene? Let's see where Jesse is.\n\nJesse started this chain: Jesse → Joshua → Terry → Alan → Abigail → Virginia → Bradley → Sean → Frances → Alexander → Stephen → Heather → Emily → Jacob → Nicholas → Gabriel → Justin → Marilyn → Barbara → Andrea → Margaret → Gloria → Gary → Shirley → Emma → Ethan → Maria → Melissa → Madison → Dorothy → Carl → Joe → Deborah → Douglas → George → Alexis → Lawrence →

Scott → Joseph → William → Benjamin → Janice → Elizabeth → Raymond → Jacqueline → Jordan → Vincent → Juan → Diane → Ann → Theresa → Kenneth → Steven → Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nJesse is at the beginning, and Eugene at the end, so Jesse is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nIs that right?\n\nJesse → Joshua → ... → Eugene.\n\nYes, from the chain above.\n\nJesse is Joshua's ancestor, and Joshua leads to Eugene through many steps.\n\nSo Jesse is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nTherefore, Jesse is Eugene's ancestor.\n\nSo option 1: Jesse is Eugene's ancestor.\n\nBut let me confirm if the chain is correct.\n\nI have Jesse → Joshua.\n\nThen Joshua → Terry (since Terry is Joshua's descendant, so Joshua ancestor of Terry).\n\nIn the chain: Joshua → Terry.\n\nThen Terry → Alan (Terry is Alan's ancestor).\n\nAlan → Abigail (Abigail is Alan's descendant).\n\nAnd so on, down to Eugene.\n\nAt the end: Robert → Eugene.\n\nAnd Robert is descendant of Charlotte, etc.\n\nIn the chain, I have from Jesse to Eugene directly through the path.\n\nIs there any break?\n\nFor example, when I have \"X is Y's descendant\", it means Y is ancestor of X.\n\nSimilarly, \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X is

Charlotte's descendant: Charlotte → Robert\n\n- Robert is Eugene's ancestor: Robert → Eugene\n\nYes, so Jesse → ... → Eugene, so Jesse is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nTherefore, Jesse is Eugene's ancestor.\n\nSo the answer should be option 1.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a shorter path or something, but it doesn't matter; as long as there is a path, Jesse is an ancestor.\n\nAlso, check if Jesse could be a descendant, but from the chain, Jesse is at the start, so ancestor.\n\nOption 2 would be if Eugene is ancestor of Jesse, but here Jesse is before Eugene.\n\nIn the chain, Jesse comes first, then Eugene later, so Jesse is ancestor.\n\nTo be thorough, is there any indication that Jesse and Eugene are the same? No, different names.\n\nOr if there is a cycle, but lineage shouldn't have cycles, so it should be a tree or DAG.\n\nIn this case, it seems a single path from Jesse to Eugene.\n\nActually, it might not be a single path; there could be multiple branches, but in this chain, it's connected directly.\n\nFor example, some people might have multiple ancestors, but here the relationships given seem to form a path without branches for this connection.\n\nIn the list, there might be other connections, but for Jesse to Eugene, this path exists.\n\nFor instance, is there another way?\n\nBut since this path exists, Jesse is definitely an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nTherefore, option 1 is correct.\n\nBut let me see the options again.\n\n1. Jesse is Eugene's ancestor. — which seems true.\n\n2. Jesse is Eugene's descendant. — false, since Jesse is earlier.\n\n3. Jesse and Eugene share a common ancestor. — well, they do, but since one is ancestor of the other, they share all ancestors of the descendant, but specifically, Jesse is the ancestor, so it's more direct.\n\nBut option 1 is more precise.\n\n4. Share a common descendant — not necessary.\n\n5. None.\n\nBut since 1 is true, it should be 1.\n\nThe question is to determine the relationship, and 1 is correct.\n\nBut let me confirm with a smaller part.\n\nFor example, from Jesse to Eugene.\n\nJesse → Joshua → Terry → Alan → ... and so on to Eugene.\n\nSince all steps are ancestor-descendant, transitive, so Jesse is ancestor of Eugene.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can find a shorter path.\n\nFor example, is there a direct link?\n\nJesse is only connected to Joshua.\n\nEugene to Robert.\n\nRobert to Charlotte, etc.\n\nBut through the chain, it connects.\n\nAnother point: in the list, there is \"Jeremy is Helen's descendant\" and \"Jeremy is Jose's ancestor\", but Jeremy is also connected to Helen.\n\nBut in the chain, it's included.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I believe Jesse is Eugene's ancestor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"Determine the lineage relationship\" and options include \"share a common ancestor\" which might be true but not the most specific.\n\nBut since one is directly ancestor, option 1 should be selected.\n\nIn some contexts, if they are not directly related but through a chain, it's still ancestor.\n\nFor example, grandparent is ancestor.\n\nSo yes.\n\nOption 3 might be true, but it's weaker; since 1 is true, it should be chosen.\n\nSimilarly, in multiple choice, we pick the most accurate.\n\nHere, 1 is correct.\n\nPerhaps I should check if Eugene is Jesse's descendant or something.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother thing: in the chain, I have Jesse to Eugene, but is Jesse necessarily an ancestor? In lineage, yes.\n\nFor example, if there is a loop, but lineage shouldn't have loops, so it should be fine.\n\nAll relationships are consistent with a tree.\n\nFor instance, no one is both ancestor and descendant of another, which would cause cycle.\n\nSo it should be acyclic.\n\nTherefore, Jesse is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nSo answer should be 1.\n","reasoning_details":[{"format":null,"index":0,"type":"reasoning.text","text":"\nI need to determine the lineage relationship between Jesse and Eugene. The options are:\n\n1. Jesse is Eugene's ancestor.\n\n2. Jesse is Eugene's descendant.\n\n3. Jesse and Eugene share a common ancestor.\n\n4. Jesse and Eugene share a common descendant.\n\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nFirst, I should map out all the relationships given. There are many, so I'll need to organize them into a family tree or at least find connections between Jesse and Eugene.\n\nLet me list all the relationships that might connect to Jesse or Eugene.\n\nJesse is mentioned in: \"Jesse is Joshua's ancestor.\"\n\nEugene is mentioned in: \"Robert is Eugene's ancestor.\"\n\nSo, Robert is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from Jesse to Eugene or vice versa.\n\nSince it's a lineage, I should look for common ancestors or descendants.\n\nOption 3 is about sharing a common ancestor, which might be the case if they are cousins or something, but lineage here seems direct, like parent-child, but it says \"ancestor\" and \"descendant,\" so it could be multiple generations.\n\nThe relationships are given as direct ancestor-descendant pairs, but since it's \"ancestor,\" it could be grandparent or further.\n\nSimilarly for descendant.\n\nBut for Jesse and Eugene, I need to see if one is directly related or if they share a common point.\n\nFirst, let's find who Jesse is connected to.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- Jesse is Joshua's ancestor.\n\nAlso, Joshua is mentioned elsewhere? Let me see.\n\n\"Jesse is Joshua's ancestor.\"\n\nAnd \"Terry is Joshua's descendant.\" But Terry is a descendant, so Joshua is an ancestor of Terry? No.\n\n\"Terry is Joshua's descendant\" means Joshua is an ancestor of Terry.\n\nSimilarly, \"Jesse is Joshua's ancestor\" means Jesse is an ancestor of Joshua.\n\nSo Jesse → Joshua → ... → Terry, but Terry might not be directly related to Eugene.\n\nI need to find a chain.\n\nSimilarly, Eugene: Robert is Eugene's ancestor, so Robert → Eugene.\n\nNow, Robert is also mentioned: \"Robert is Charlotte's descendant.\" and \"Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor.\"\n\nLet's list all connections involving Robert or Eugene.\n\nEugene: only \"Robert is Eugene's ancestor\" so far.\n\nRobert: \"Robert is Eugene's ancestor\" and \"Robert is Charlotte's descendant.\"\n\nAlso, \"Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor\" from \"Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor.\"\n\nLet's find Charlotte.\n\n\"Robert is Charlotte's descendant\" so Charlotte is an ancestor of Robert.\n\nAnd \"Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor\" so Evelyn is an ancestor of Charlotte.\n\nTherefore, Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nSo Evelyn is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nNow, Jesse: \"Jesse is Joshua's ancestor.\"\n\nWho is Joshua connected to?\n\n\"Terry is Joshua's descendant\" so Joshua is an ancestor of Terry.\n\nAlso, \"Jesse is Joshua's ancestor\" so Jesse → Joshua → Terry.\n\nBut Terry might connect to others.\n\n\"Terry is Alan's ancestor\" from \"Terry is Alan's ancestor.\"\n\nAnd \"Abigail is Alan's descendant\" so Alan is an ancestor of Abigail.\n\nAlso, \"Virginia is Abigail's descendant\" so Abigail is an ancestor of Virginia.\n\nThis is getting messy. I need to find a common link.\n\nPerhaps I should look for people who connect to both sides.\n\nAnother idea: maybe Eugene and Jesse are related through multiple paths.\n\nLet me list all the relationships in a graph or something.\n\nSince it's text, I can group by names.\n\nFirst, let's find all ancestors and descendants for key people.\n\nStart with Eugene.\n\nEugene has Robert as ancestor.\n\nRobert has Charlotte as ancestor (since Robert is Charlotte's descendant, so Charlotte is ancestor of Robert).\n\nCharlotte has Evelyn as ancestor (Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor).\n\nSo Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nNow, Evelyn: who is Evelyn's ancestor?\n\n\"Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor\" but that's for Charlotte, not for Evelyn.\n\nIs there anyone who is Evelyn's ancestor?\n\nLet's see: \"Steven is Evelyn's ancestor\" from \"Steven is Evelyn's ancestor.\"\n\nYes: \"Steven is Evelyn's ancestor.\"\n\nSo Steven → Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nNow, Steven: who is Steven's ancestor?\n\n\"Kenneth is Steven's ancestor\" from \"Kenneth is Steven's ancestor.\"\n\nAnd \"Theresa is Kenneth's ancestor\" from \"Theresa is Kenneth's ancestor.\"\n\nSo Theresa → Kenneth → Steven → Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nNow, Theresa: is there more? \"Theresa is Ann's descendant\" from \"Theresa is Ann's descendant.\"\n\n\"Theresa is Ann's descendant\" means Ann is ancestor of Theresa.\n\nSo Ann → Theresa → Kenneth → Steven → Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nBut Ann might have ancestors.\n\n\"Ann is Diane's descendant\" from

Jesse to Eugene? Let's see where Jesse is.\n\nJesse started this chain: Jesse → Joshua → Terry → Alan → Abigail → Virginia → Bradley → Sean → Frances → Alexander → Stephen → Heather → Emily → Jacob → Nicholas → Gabriel → Justin → Marilyn → Barbara → Andrea → Margaret → Gloria → Gary → Shirley → Emma → Ethan → Maria → Melissa → Madison → Dorothy → Carl → Joe → Deborah → Douglas → George → Alexis → Lawrence → Kevin → Randy → Helen → Jeremy → Jose → Lori → Lauren → Rebecca → Donald → Nathan → Michael → Henry → Michelle → Philip → Dennis → Stephanie → Jason → Willie → Adam → Kathryn → Kathleen → Bruce →

Scott → Joseph → William → Benjamin → Janice → Elizabeth → Raymond → Jacqueline → Jordan → Vincent → Juan → Diane → Ann → Theresa → Kenneth → Steven → Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nJesse is at the beginning, and Eugene at the end, so Jesse is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nIs that right?\n\nJesse → Joshua → ... → Eugene.\n\nYes, from the chain above.\n\nJesse is Joshua's ancestor, and Joshua leads to Eugene through many steps.\n\nSo Jesse is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nTherefore, Jesse is Eugene's ancestor.\n\nSo option 1: Jesse is Eugene's ancestor.\n\nBut let me confirm if the chain is correct.\n\nI have Jesse → Joshua.\n\nThen Joshua → Terry (since Terry is Joshua's descendant, so Joshua ancestor of Terry).\n\nIn the chain: Joshua → Terry.\n\nThen Terry → Alan (Terry is Alan's ancestor).\n\nAlan → Abigail (Abigail is Alan's descendant).\n\nAnd so on, down to Eugene.\n\nAt the end: Robert → Eugene.\n\nAnd Robert is descendant of Charlotte, etc.\n\nIn the chain, I have from Jesse to Eugene directly through the path.\n\nIs there any break?\n\nFor example, when I have \"X is Y's descendant\", it means Y is ancestor of X.\n\nSimilarly, \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X is

Charlotte's descendant: Charlotte → Robert\n\n- Robert is Eugene's ancestor: Robert → Eugene\n\nYes, so Jesse → ... → Eugene, so Jesse is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nTherefore, Jesse is Eugene's ancestor.\n\nSo the answer should be option 1.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a shorter path or something, but it doesn't matter; as long as there is a path, Jesse is an ancestor.\n\nAlso, check if Jesse could be a descendant, but from the chain, Jesse is at the start, so ancestor.\n\nOption 2 would be if Eugene is ancestor of Jesse, but here Jesse is before Eugene.\n\nIn the chain, Jesse comes first, then Eugene later, so Jesse is ancestor.\n\nTo be thorough, is there any indication that Jesse and Eugene are the same? No, different names.\n\nOr if there is a cycle, but lineage shouldn't have cycles, so it should be a tree or DAG.\n\nIn this case, it seems a single path from Jesse to Eugene.\n\nActually, it might not be a single path; there could be multiple branches, but in this chain, it's connected directly.\n\nFor example, some people might have multiple ancestors, but here the relationships given seem to form a path without branches for this connection.\n\nIn the list, there might be other connections, but for Jesse to Eugene, this path exists.\n\nFor instance, is there another way?\n\nBut since this path exists, Jesse is definitely an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nTherefore, option 1 is correct.\n\nBut let me see the options again.\n\n1. Jesse is Eugene's ancestor. — which seems true.\n\n2. Jesse is Eugene's descendant. — false, since Jesse is earlier.\n\n3. Jesse and Eugene share a common ancestor. — well, they do, but since one is ancestor of the other, they share all ancestors of the descendant, but specifically, Jesse is the ancestor, so it's more direct.\n\nBut option 1 is more precise.\n\n4. Share a common descendant — not necessary.\n\n5. None.\n\nBut since 1 is true, it should be 1.\n\nThe question is to determine the relationship, and 1 is correct.\n\nBut let me confirm with a smaller part.\n\nFor example, from Jesse to Eugene.\n\nJesse → Joshua → Terry → Alan → ... and so on to Eugene.\n\nSince all steps are ancestor-descendant, transitive, so Jesse is ancestor of Eugene.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can find a shorter path.\n\nFor example, is there a direct link?\n\nJesse is only connected to Joshua.\n\nEugene to Robert.\n\nRobert to Charlotte, etc.\n\nBut through the chain, it connects.\n\nAnother point: in the list, there is \"Jeremy is Helen's descendant\" and \"Jeremy is Jose's ancestor\", but Jeremy is also connected to Helen.\n\nBut in the chain, it's included.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I believe Jesse is Eugene's ancestor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"Determine the lineage relationship\" and options include \"share a common ancestor\" which might be true but not the most specific.\n\nBut since one is directly ancestor, option 1 should be selected.\n\nIn some contexts, if they are not directly related but through a chain, it's still ancestor.\n\nFor example, grandparent is ancestor.\n\nSo yes.\n\nOption 3 might be true, but it's weaker; since 1 is true, it should be chosen.\n\nSimilarly, in multiple choice, we pick the most accurate.\n\nHere, 1 is correct.\n\nPerhaps I should check if Eugene is Jesse's descendant or something.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother thing: in the chain, I have Jesse to Eugene, but is Jesse necessarily an ancestor? In lineage, yes.\n\nFor example, if there is a loop, but lineage shouldn't have loops, so it should be fine.\n\nAll relationships are consistent with a tree.\n\nFor instance, no one is both ancestor and descendant of another, which would cause cycle.\n\nSo it should be acyclic.\n\nTherefore, Jesse is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\nSo answer should be 1.\n"}]}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1452,"total_tokens":13186,"completion_tokens":11734,"estimated_cost":0.0344642,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
