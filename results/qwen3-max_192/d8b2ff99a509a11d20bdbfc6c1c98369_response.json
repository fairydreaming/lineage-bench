So actually, **Adam** is at the very top of a long chain that eventually leads to **Daniel**, and from earlier, **Daniel → ... → James**\n\nWait, let's verify if **Adam connects to Daniel**.\n\nWe had:\n- Adam → Rachel → Amber → John → Emily → Sarah → Gloria → Scott → Kelly → William → Billy → Brittany → Heather → Elijah → Melissa → Jean → Patricia → Matthew → Andrew → Jacqueline → Richard →
