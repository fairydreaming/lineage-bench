Maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, let's trace **Janice upward**:\n\nJanice  \n← Amber  \n← Sara  \n← Patricia  \n← Helen  \n← Roy  \n← George (George is Roy's ancestor → Roy is George's descendant)  \n→ So George is an ancestor of Roy → George → Roy → Helen → Patricia → Sara → Amber → Janice\n\nAlso: **George is Kayla's descendant** → Kayla → George → ... → Janice  \nSo **Kayla is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Kayla is Michael's descendant** → Michael → Kayla → ... → Janice  \nSo **Michael is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Terry is Michael's ancestor** → Terry → Michael → ... → Janice  \nSo **Terry is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Terry is Pamela's descendant** → Pamela → Terry → ... → Janice  \nSo **Pamela is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Pamela is Gary's descendant** → Gary → Pamela → ... → Janice  \nSo **Gary is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Kimberly is Gary's ancestor** → Kimberly → Gary → ... → Janice  \nSo **Kimberly is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Kimberly is Ralph's descendant** → Ralph → Kimberly → ... → Janice  \nSo **Ralph is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Alexis is Ralph's ancestor** → Alexis → Ralph → ... → Janice  \nSo **Alexis is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Lori is Alexis's ancestor** → Lori → Alexis → ... → Janice  \nSo **Lori is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Charlotte is Lori's ancestor** → Charlotte → Lori → ... → Janice  \nSo **Charlotte is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Charlotte is Heather's descendant** → Heather → Charlotte → ... → Janice  \nSo **Heather is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Heather is Bradley's descendant** → Bradley → Heather → ... → Janice  \nSo **Bradley is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Andrea is Bradley's ancestor** → Andrea → Bradley → ... → Janice  \nSo **Andrea is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Andrea is Bobby's descendant** → Bobby → Andrea → ... → Janice  \nSo **Bobby is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Edward is Bobby's ancestor** → Edward → Bobby → ... → Janice  \nSo **Edward is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Grace is Edward's ancestor** → Grace → Edward → ... → Janice  \nSo **Grace is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nAlso: **Carol is Kyle's ancestor**, and **Kyle is Grace's ancestor** → Carol → Kyle → Grace → ... → Janice  \nSo **Carol is an ancestor of Janice**\n\nNow, let's trace **Kathryn upward**:\n\nKathryn  \n← Jose (Jose is ancestor → Kathryn is descendant)  \n← Aaron (Jose is Aaron's descendant → Aaron is ancestor of Jose → so Aaron is ancestor of Kathryn)\n\nSo: Aaron → Jose → Kathryn\n\nNow, can we connect **Aaron** to any of the ancestors we found in Janice’s lineage?\n\nLook for any mention of **Aaron** elsewhere:\n\n- **Matthew is Aaron's ancestor.** (from: Matthew is Aaron's ancestor.)\n- **Matthew is Jennifer's descendant.** → Jennifer → Matthew → Aaron → Jose → Kathryn\n\nSo: Jennifer → Matthew → Aaron → Jose → Kathryn\n\nNow, is **Jennifer** connected to Janice’s side?\n\n- **Jennifer is Kevin's descendant.**\n- **Kevin is Jerry's descendant.**\n- **Charles is Jerry's ancestor.** → Charles → Jerry → Kevin → Jennifer → ...\n\nAlso: **Patrick is Charles's ancestor.** → Patrick → Charles → ...\n\nAlso: **Patrick is Joseph's descendant.** → Joseph → Patrick → ...\n\nAlso: **Maria is Joseph's ancestor.** → Maria → Joseph → ...\n\nAlso: **Abigail is Maria's ancestor.** → Abigail → Maria → ...\n\nAlso: **Abigail is Gloria's descendant.** → Gloria → Abigail → ...\n\nAlso: **Gloria is Angela's descendant.** → Angela → Gloria → ...\n\nAlso: **Diana is Angela's ancestor.** → Diana → Angela → ...\n\nAlso: **Julie is Diana's ancestor.** → Julie → Diana → ...\n\nAlso: **Jack is Julie's ancestor.** → Jack → Julie → ...\n\nAlso: **Jack is Bryan's descendant.** → Bryan → Jack → ...\n\nAlso: **Bryan is Sharon's descendant.** → Sharon → Bryan → ...\n\nAlso: **Stephanie is Sharon's ancestor.** → Stephanie → Sharon → ...\n\nAlso: **Roger is Stephanie's ancestor.** → Roger → Stephanie → ...\n\nAlso: **Nathan is Roger's ancestor.** → Nathan → Roger → ...\n\nAlso: **Nathan is Diane's descendant.** → Diane → Nathan → ...\n\nAlso: **Arthur is Diane's ancestor.** → Arthur → Diane → ...\n\nAlso: **Arthur is Brittany's descendant.** → Brittany → Arthur → ...\n\nAlso: **Ruth is Brittany's ancestor.** → Ruth → Brittany → ...\n\nAlso: **Benjamin is Ruth's ancestor.** → Benjamin → Ruth → ...\n\nAlso: **Andrew is Benjamin's ancestor.** → Andrew → Benjamin → ...\n\nAlso: **Andrew is Christine's descendant.** → Christine → Andrew → ...\n\nAlso: **Christine is Madison's descendant.** → Madison → Christine → ...\n\nAlso: **Christina is Madison's ancestor.** → Christina → Madison → ...\n\nAlso: **Christina is Scott's descendant.** → Scott → Christina → ...\n\nAlso: **Scott is Kenneth's descendant.** → Kenneth → Scott → ...\n\nAlso: **Kenneth is William's descendant.** → William → Kenneth → ...\n\nAlso: **David is William's ancestor.** → David → William → ...\n\nAlso: **Walter is David's ancestor.** → Walter → David → ...\n\nAlso: **Lisa is Walter's ancestor.** → Lisa → Walter → ...\n\nThis is getting extremely long, and we’re not seeing a clear link to Janice’s side.\n\nLet’s consider another approach: **Is there any person who appears in both Janice’s ancestry and Kathryn’s ancestry?**\n\nJanice’s ancestors (from earlier):\n- Amber, Sara, Patricia, Helen, Roy, George, Kayla, Michael, Terry, Pamela, Gary, Kimberly, Ralph, Alexis, Lori, Charlotte, Heather, Bradley, Andrea, Bobby, Edward, Grace, Carol, Kyle\n\nKathryn’s ancestors:\n- Jose, Aaron, Matthew, Jennifer, Kevin, Jerry, Charles, Patrick, Joseph, Maria, Abigail, Gloria, Angela, Diana, Julie, Jack, Bryan, Sharon, Stephanie, Roger, Nathan, Diane, Arthur, Brittany, Ruth, Benjamin, Andrew, Christine, Madison, Christina, Scott, Kenneth, William, David, Walter, Lisa\n\nDo these sets intersect?\n\nLet’s compare:\n\n- Is **Carol** in Kathryn’s list? No.\n- **Kyle**? No.\n- **Grace**? No.\n- **Edward**? No.\n- **Bobby**? No.\n- **Andrea**? No.\n- **Bradley**? No.\n- **Heather**? No.\n- **Charlotte**? No.\n- **Lori**? No.\n- **Alexis**? No.\n- **Ralph**? No.\n- **Kimberly**? No.\n- **Gary**? No.\n- **Pamela**? No.\n- **Terry**? No.\n- **Michael**? No.\n- **Kayla**? No.\n- **George**? No.\n- **Roy**? No.\n- **Helen**? No.\n- **Patricia**? No.\n- **Sara**? No.\n- **Amber**? No.\n\nNow check Kathryn’s ancestors for any in Janice’s list — none seem to match.\n\nNow check **descendants** — could they share a common descendant?\n\nWe know:\n\n- Janice is a descendant of Amber, etc.\n- Kathryn is a descendant of Jose, etc.\n\nDo we have any person who is a **descendant of both Janice and Kathryn**? That would require someone listed as a descendant of Janice (or her descendants) and also of Kathryn.\n\nBut we are not given any descendants of **Janice** — only that she is Amber’s descendant. So Janice appears only in one statement: \"Janice is Amber's descendant.\" So we don’t know who, if anyone, descends from Janice.\n\nSimilarly, **Kathryn** appears only in: \"Jose is Kathryn's ancestor.\" So we don’t have any descendants of Kathryn listed.\n\nTherefore, **they do not share a listed common descendant**.\n\nNow, is **Janice an ancestor or descendant of Kathryn**?\n\nFor Janice to be Kathryn’s ancestor, there must be a chain from Janice down to Kathryn.\n\nBut Janice is only known as a descendant (of Amber). There’s no info that anyone descends from Janice.\n\nSimilarly, Kathryn is only known as a descendant (of Jose). No info that she has descendants.\n\nSo no direct ancestor/descendant relationship is indicated.\n\nNow, could they share a **common ancestor**?\n\nThat would mean there exists some person X such that X is an ancestor of both Janice and Kathryn.\n\nWe need to see if their ancestor chains intersect.\n\nLet’s try to go further up Janice’s line.\n\nWe had:\n\nJanice ← Amber ← Sara ← Patricia ← Helen ← Roy\n\nNow, **George is Roy's ancestor** → so George ↑ Roy\n\nAlso: **George is Kayla's descendant** → Kayla ↑ George\n\nSo Kayla ↑ George ↑ Roy ↑ Helen ↑ Patricia ↑ Sara ↑ Amber ↑ Janice\n\nSo Kayla is an ancestor of Janice.\n\nNow, **Kayla is Michael's descendant** → Michael ↑ Kayla\n\nSo Michael ↑ Kayla ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Terry is Michael's ancestor** → Terry ↑ Michael ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\nAlso: **Terry is Pamela's descendant** → Pamela ↑ Terry\n\nSo Pamela ↑ Terry ↑ Michael ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Pamela is Gary's descendant** → Gary ↑ Pamela\n\nSo Gary ↑ Pamela ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Kimberly is Gary's ancestor** → Kimberly ↑ Gary\n\nSo Kimberly ↑ Gary ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Kimberly is Ralph's descendant** → Ralph ↑ Kimberly\n\nSo Ralph ↑ Kimberly ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Alexis is Ralph's ancestor** → Alexis ↑ Ralph\n\nSo Alexis ↑ Ralph ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Lori is Alexis's ancestor** → Lori ↑ Alexis\n\nSo Lori ↑ Alexis ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Charlotte is Lori's ancestor** → Charlotte ↑ Lori\n\nSo Charlotte ↑ Lori ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Charlotte is Heather's descendant** → Heather ↑ Charlotte\n\nSo Heather ↑ Charlotte ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Heather is Bradley's descendant** → Bradley ↑ Heather\n\nSo Bradley ↑ Heather ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Andrea is Bradley's ancestor** → Andrea ↑ Bradley\n\nSo Andrea ↑ Bradley ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Andrea is Bobby's descendant** → Bobby ↑ Andrea\n\nSo Bobby ↑ Andrea ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Edward is Bobby's ancestor** → Edward ↑ Bobby\n\nSo Edward ↑ Bobby ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Grace is Edward's ancestor** → Grace ↑ Edward\n\nSo Grace ↑ Edward ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\n**Carol is Kyle's ancestor**, and **Kyle is Grace's ancestor** → Carol ↑ Kyle ↑ Grace ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\nSo Carol ↑ Kyle ↑ Grace ↑ Edward ↑ ... ↑ Janice\n\nNow, go up Kathryn’s side again:\n\nKathryn ← Jose ← Aaron\n\n**Matthew is Aaron's ancestor** → Matthew ↑ Aaron\n\n**Matthew is Jennifer's descendant** → Jennifer ↑ Matthew\n\n**Jennifer is Kevin's descendant** → Kevin ↑ Jennifer\n\n**Kevin is Jerry's descendant** → Jerry ↑ Kevin\n\n**Charles is Jerry's ancestor** → Charles ↑ Jerry\n\n**Patrick is Charles's ancestor** → Patrick ↑ Charles\n\n**Patrick is Joseph's descendant** → Joseph ↑ Patrick\n\n**Maria is Joseph's ancestor** → Maria ↑ Joseph\n\n**Abigail is Maria's ancestor** → Abigail ↑ Maria\n\n**Abigail is Gloria's descendant** → Gloria ↑ Abigail\n\n**Gloria is Angela's descendant** → Angela ↑ Gloria\n\n**Diana is Angela's ancestor** → Diana ↑ Angela\n\n**Julie is Diana's ancestor** → Julie ↑ Diana\n\n**Jack is Julie's ancestor** → Jack ↑ Julie\n\n**Jack is Bryan's descendant** → Bryan ↑ Jack\n\n**Bryan is Sharon's descendant** → Sharon ↑ Bryan\n\n**Stephanie is Sharon's ancestor** → Stephanie ↑ Sharon\n\n**Roger is Stephanie's ancestor** → Roger ↑ Stephanie\n\n**Nathan is Roger's ancestor** → Nathan ↑ Roger\n\n**Nathan is Diane's descendant** → Diane ↑ Nathan\n\n**Arthur is Diane's ancestor** → Arthur ↑ Diane\n\n**Arthur is Brittany's descendant** → Brittany ↑ Arthur\n\n**Ruth is Brittany's ancestor** → Ruth ↑ Brittany\n\n**Benjamin is Ruth's ancestor** → Benjamin ↑ Ruth\n\n**Andrew is Benjamin's ancestor** → Andrew ↑ Benjamin\n\n**Andrew is Christine's descendant** → Christine ↑ Andrew\n\n**Christine is Madison's descendant** → Madison ↑ Christine\n\n**Christina is Madison's ancestor** → Christina ↑ Madison\n\n**Christina is Scott's descendant** → Scott ↑ Christina\n\n**Scott is Kenneth's descendant** → Kenneth ↑ Scott\n\n**Kenneth is William's descendant** → William ↑ Kenneth\n\n**David is William's ancestor** → David ↑ William\n\n**Walter is David's ancestor** → Walter ↑ David\n\n**Lisa is Walter's ancestor** → Lisa ↑ Walter\n\nSo Kathryn’s ancestors include: Lisa, Walter, David, William, Kenneth, Scott, Christina, Madison, Christine, Andrew, Benjamin, Ruth, Brittany, Arthur, Diane, Nathan, Roger, Stephanie, Sharon, Bryan, Jack, Julie, Diana, Angela, Gloria, Abigail, Maria, Joseph, Patrick, Charles, Jerry, Kevin, Jennifer, Matthew, Aaron, Jose\n\nNow, compare with Janice’s ancestors again:\n\nAmber, Sara, Patricia, Helen, Roy, George, Kayla, Michael, Terry, Pamela, Gary, Kimberly, Ralph, Alexis, Lori, Charlotte, Heather, Bradley, Andrea, Bobby, Edward, Grace, Kyle, Carol\n\nNo overlap.\n\nBut wait — let's check **George**.\n\nGeorge is Roy's ancestor → so George is in Janice’s ancestry.\n\nIs George in Kathryn’s ancestry?\n\nKathryn’s ancestry includes: ... we don’t see George.\n\nWhat about **David**? David is in Kathryn’s ancestry.\n\nIs David in Janice’s ancestry?\n\nJanice’s ancestry includes Michael, Terry, etc. Is there a link between **Michael** and **David**?\n\nWe have:\n\n- **Terry is Michael's ancestor**\n- **Lisa is Walter's ancestor**\n- **Walter is David's ancestor**\n\nBut no link between Terry and Lisa/Walter/David.\n\nAnother angle: Look for any person who is an ancestor of both.\n\nAlternatively, consider **common descendant**.\n\nIs there anyone who is a descendant of both?\n\nWe have **Jordan is Gabriel's descendant**, and **Gabriel is Joe's descendant**, and **Joe is Frances's descendant**, and **Alan is Frances's descendant**, and **Alan is Joan's ancestor**\n\nBut nothing ties to Janice or Kathryn.\n\nGiven the data, **there is no chain connecting Janice and Kathryn** either through common ancestor, common descendant, or direct lineage.\n\nBut wait! Let's double-check one thing:\n\nWe have:\n\n- **Denise is Nicole's descendant.**\n- **Jessica is Nicole's ancestor.**\n- **Jessica is Brandon's descendant.**\n- **Brandon is Susan's descendant.**\n- **Susan is Ronald's descendant.**\n- **Dorothy is Ronald's ancestor.**\n- **Dorothy is Alice's descendant.**\n- **Carl is Alice's ancestor.**\n- **Thomas is Carl's ancestor.**\n- **Isabella is Thomas's ancestor.**\n- **Henry is Isabella's ancestor.**\n- **Sandra is Henry's ancestor.**\n- **Joyce is Sandra's ancestor.**\n- **Joyce is Victoria's descendant.**\n- **Victoria is Mason's descendant.**\n- **Mason is Rachel's descendant.**\n- **Samantha is Rachel's ancestor.**\n- **Samantha is Vincent's descendant.**\n- **Donald is Vincent's ancestor.**\n- **Donald is Theresa's descendant.**\n- **Theresa is Gerald's descendant.**\n- **Dennis is Gerald's ancestor.**\n- **Dennis is Deborah's descendant.**\n- **Deborah is Amy's descendant.**\n- **Amy is Amanda's descendant.**\n- **Sarah is Amanda's ancestor.**\n- **Sarah is Barbara's descendant.**\n- **Peter is Barbara's ancestor.**\n- **Joan is Peter's ancestor.**\n- **Alan is Joan's ancestor.**\n\nStill no Janice or Kathryn.\n\nNow, consider this: **Is it possible that Janice and Kathryn are completely disconnected in the given data?**\n\nIf so, then the answer would be **5. None of the above is correct.**\n\nBut wait — let's check one more thing.\n\nWe have:\n\n- **Jose is Kathryn's ancestor.**\n- **Jose is Aaron's descendant.**\n- **Matthew is Aaron's ancestor.**\n- **Matthew is Jennifer's descendant.**\n- **Jennifer is Kevin's descendant.**\n- **Kevin is Jerry's descendant.**\n- **Charles is Jerry's ancestor.**\n- **Patrick is Charles's ancestor.**\n- **Patrick is Joseph's descendant.**\n- **Maria is Joseph's ancestor.**\n- **Abigail is Maria's ancestor.**\n- **Abigail is Gloria's descendant.**\n- **Gloria is Angela's descendant.**\n- **Diana is Angela's ancestor.**\n- **Julie is Diana's ancestor.**\n- **Jack is Julie's ancestor.**\n- **Jack is Bryan's descendant.**\n- **Bryan is Sharon's descendant.**\n- **Stephanie is Sharon's ancestor.**\n- **Roger is Stephanie's ancestor.**\n- **Nathan is Roger's ancestor.**\n- **Nathan is Diane's descendant.**\n- **Arthur is Diane's ancestor.**\n- **Arthur is Brittany's descendant.**\n- **Ruth is Brittany's ancestor.**\n- **Benjamin is Ruth's ancestor.**\n- **Andrew is Benjamin's ancestor.**\n- **Andrew is Christine's descendant.**\n- **Christine is Madison's descendant.**\n- **Christina is Madison's ancestor.**\n- **Christina is Scott's descendant.**\n- **Scott is Kenneth's descendant.**\n- **Kenneth is William's descendant.**\n- **David is William's ancestor.**\n- **Walter is David's ancestor.**\n- **Lisa is Walter's ancestor.**\n\nNow, is **Lisa** connected to Janice?\n\nWe have **Laura is Carolyn's ancestor.**\n**Carolyn is Lawrence's ancestor.**\n**Martha is Lawrence's descendant.**\n**Teresa is Martha's descendant.**\n**Nancy is Teresa's descendant.**\n**Paul is Nancy's descendant.**\n**Ashley is Paul's descendant.**\n**Ashley is James's ancestor.**\n**Evelyn is James's descendant.**\n**Evelyn is Doris's ancestor.**\n**Doris is Karen's ancestor.**\n**Karen is Sean's ancestor.**\n**Sean is Nicholas's ancestor.**\n**Brian is Nicholas's descendant.**\n**Mark is Brian's descendant.**\n**Michelle is Mark's descendant.**\n**Natalie is Michelle's descendant.**\n**Natalie is Brenda's ancestor.**\n**Brenda is Robert's ancestor.**\n**Robert is Frank's ancestor.**\n**Frank is Jacob's ancestor.**\n**Cynthia is Jacob's descendant.**\n**Cynthia is Samuel's ancestor.**\n**Samuel is Margaret's ancestor.**\n**Margaret is Wayne's ancestor.**\n**Eric is Wayne's descendant.**\n**Eric is Anna's ancestor.**\n**Anna is Juan's ancestor.**\n**Adam is Juan's descendant.**\n**Adam is Julia's ancestor.**\n**Julia is Elijah's ancestor.**\n**Melissa is Elijah's descendant.**\n**Emma is Melissa's descendant.**\n**Emma is Douglas's ancestor.**\n**Douglas is Raymond's ancestor.**\n**Keith is Raymond's descendant.**\n**Anthony is Keith's descendant.**\n**Anthony is Kathleen's ancestor.**\n**Kathleen is Christian's ancestor.**\n**Christian is Jeffrey's ancestor.**\n**Jeffrey is Linda's ancestor.**\n**Janet is Linda's descendant.**\n**Billy is Janet's descendant.**\n**Austin is Billy's descendant.**\n**Austin is Tyler's ancestor.**\n**Catherine is Tyler's descendant.**\n**Philip is Catherine's descendant.**\n**Philip is Marie's ancestor.**\n**Marie is Joshua's ancestor.**\n**Olivia is Joshua's descendant.**\n**Bruce is Olivia's descendant.**\n**Willie is Bruce's descendant.**\n**Albert is Willie's descendant.**\n**Emily is Albert's descendant.**\n**Emily is Shirley's ancestor.**\n**Lauren is Shirley's descendant.**\n**Alexander is Lauren's descendant.**\n**Alexander is Russell's ancestor.**\n**Russell is Lisa's ancestor.**\n\nWait!
