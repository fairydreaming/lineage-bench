descendant.**\n- **Brian is Edward's descendant.**\n- **Jason is Brian's descendant.**\n- **Jason is Emily's ancestor.**\n- ... and so on.\n\nBut we need to connect **Nicholas** to this chain.\n\nWe have:\n\n- **Nicholas → Lawrence → Donald → Ralph → Katherine → Anthony → James → Alice → Debra → Vincent → Jeffrey → Harold → Joseph → Noah → Lisa → Jean → Olivia → Mary → Joan → Gabriel → Bradley → Linda → Grace → Nancy → Samantha → Nathan → Madison → Patrick → Amanda → Stephen → Dennis → Helen → Philip → Mason → Susan → Brandon → Dylan → Marie → Jonathan → John → Paul → David → Larry → Stephanie → Abigail → Evelyn → Kevin → Teresa → Megan → Kimberly → Sarah → Raymond → Diane → Amy → Heather → Christine → Ashley → Jacqueline → Randy → Douglas → Jack → Carolyn → Robert → Sharon → Denise → Laura → Austin → Barbara → Roy → Thomas → Christopher → Deborah → Kayla → Mark → Arthur → Ethan → Brenda → Elijah → Charles → Christina → Kathleen → Michelle → Terry → Karen → Russell → Eugene → Julie → Kyle → Roger → Gloria → Ruth → Bryan → Daniel → Gary → Emma → Bruce → Anna → Alan → Juan → Cynthia → Willie → Theresa → Sean → Dorothy → Hannah → Nicole → Richard → Alexander → Shirley → Pamela → Angela → Peter → Keith → Wayne → Andrea → Gregory → Adam → Frank → Justin → Martha → Joyce → Kelly → Jordan → Scott → Marilyn → Eric → Danielle → Albert → Billy → Donna → Elizabeth → Michael → Lauren → Jeremy → Amber → Steven → Isabella → Ann → Tyler → Andrew → Christian → Janet → Bobby → Lori → Zachary → Maria → Betty → Diana → Kathryn → Patricia → Jesse → Jessica → Sophia → Walter → Jennifer → Beverly → George → Janice → Logan → Alexis → Julia → Joe → Natalie → Judy → Carl → William → Catherine → Aaron → Doris → Timothy → Brittany → Jacob → Matthew → Virginia → Sandra → Rebecca → Cheryl → Kenneth → Victoria → Gerald → Carol → Jerry → Rachel → Melissa → Charlotte → Jose → Emily → Jason → Brian → Edward → Frances → Margaret\n\nWait! That’s a **cycle**? Let's double-check.\n\nWe started from **Nicholas** and went forward through descendants. Then we ended up back at **Jason**, who is both ancestor and descendant? That suggests a loop, which shouldn't happen in a real lineage, but maybe we made a wrong turn.\n\nActually, the issue is that we assumed a single path, but lineage graphs can branch. However, **we don't need to trace the whole graph**. We just need to see if **Nicholas** and **Margaret** are connected via ancestor/descendant relationship **in either direction**, or share a common ancestor or descendant.\n\nLet’s take a more systematic approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Build ancestor/descendant chains for Nicholas and Margaret.\n\n#### Nicholas's descendants:\n\nGiven:\n- Nicholas is Lawrence's ancestor.\n- Lawrence is
