This is getting long.\n\nBut maybe we don't need to go that far. Let's also trace **Anna**'s lineage.\n\nWe have:\n- **Roger is Anna's ancestor.**\n- Also: **Roger is Linda's descendant.** → Roger ← ... ← Linda\n\nSo: Linda → ... → Roger → ... → Anna\n\nAlso:\n- **Linda is Melissa's descendant.** → Linda ← ... ← Melissa\n- **Aaron is Melissa's ancestor.** → Aaron → ... → Melissa → ... → Linda → ... → Roger → ... → Anna\n\nSo Aaron is an ancestor of Anna.\n\nNow, can we connect **Anna** to **Kathryn**?\n\nWe have **Natalie is Kathryn's descendant**, so **Kathryn is Natalie's ancestor**.\n\nAlso: **Natalie is Shirley's ancestor** → So Natalie → ... → Shirley\n\nSo the chain from **Kathryn** goes:  \nKathryn → ... → Natalie → ... → Shirley → ... → Karen → ... → Marilyn → ... → Jose → ... → Steven → ... → Sara → ... → Maria → ... → Kenneth → ... → Kyle → ... → Brittany → ... → Sharon → ... → Joyce → ... → Beverly → ... → Bradley → ... → Rebecca → ... → Denise → ... → Tyler → ... → Janice → ... → Wayne → ... → Margaret\n\nThat’s one path.\n\nNow, is there any connection between this chain and Anna’s chain?\n\nAnna’s known ancestors: Roger, Linda, Melissa, Aaron  \nAnna’s known descendants: none given directly.\n\nKathryn’s known descendants: Natalie  \nKathryn’s known ancestors: none given directly.\n\nSo maybe we should look for a **common ancestor** or **common descendant**.\n\nLet’s consider building **ancestor sets** and **descendant sets** for both Anna and Kathryn.\n\nBut with 100+ relationships, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Look for any person who appears in both lineages.\n\nWe know:\n\n- **Roger is Anna's ancestor.**\n- **Roger is Linda's descendant.**\n- **Linda is Melissa's descendant.**\n- **Aaron is Melissa's ancestor.**\n- **Aaron is Logan's descendant.** → So Aaron ← ... ← Logan\n- **Sandra is Logan's ancestor.** → Sandra → ... → Logan → ... → Aaron → ... → Melissa → ... → Linda → ... → Roger → ... → Anna\n\nSo Sandra is an ancestor of Anna.\n\nAlso:\n- **Theresa is Sandra's ancestor.** → Theresa → ... → Sandra → ... → Anna\n\n- **Theresa is Terry's descendant.** → Theresa ← ... ← Terry\n- **Eric is Terry's ancestor.** → Eric → ... → Terry → ... → Theresa → ... → Anna\n\n- **Eric is Justin's descendant.** → Eric ← ... ← Justin\n- **Justin is Adam's descendant.** → Justin ← ... ← Adam\n- **Adam is Henry's descendant.** → Adam ← ... ← Henry\n- **Henry is Abigail's descendant.** → Henry ← ... ← Abigail\n- **Abigail is Brandon's descendant.** → Abigail ← ... ← Brandon\n- **Larry is Brandon's ancestor.** → Larry → ... → Brandon → ... → Abigail → ... → Henry → ... → Adam → ... → Justin → ... → Eric → ... → Terry → ... → Theresa → ... → Sandra → ... → Logan → ... → Aaron → ... → Melissa → ... → Linda → ... → Roger → ... → Anna\n\nSo Larry is an ancestor of Anna.\n\nAlso:\n- **Larry is Samuel's descendant.** → Larry ← ... ← Samuel\n- **Samuel is Isabella's descendant.** → Samuel ← ... ← Isabella\n- **Amy is Isabella's ancestor.** → Amy → ... → Isabella → ... → Samuel → ... → Larry → ... → Anna\n\n- **Amy is David's descendant.** → Amy ← ... ← David\n- **David is Judith's descendant.** → David ← ... ← Judith\n- **Edward is Judith's ancestor.** → Edward → ... → Judith → ... → David → ... → Amy → ... → Isabella → ... → Samuel → ... → Larry → ... → Anna\n\nSo Edward is an ancestor of Anna.\n\nNow, can any of these people (Roger, Linda, Aaron, Sandra, Theresa, Eric, Justin, Adam, Henry, Abigail, Brandon, Larry, Samuel, Isabella, Amy, David, Judith, Edward, etc.) be connected to **Kathryn**?\n\nLet’s look at Kathryn’s side

**Roger is Anna's ancestor.**\n\nThis is a **single connected component**! It seems **everyone is connected** through this massive genealogical graph.\n\nBut the question is specifically about **Anna and Kathryn**.\n\nWe need to determine if:\n- Anna is Kathryn's ancestor\n- Anna is Kathryn's descendant\n- They share a common ancestor\n- They share a common descendant\n- None\n\nWe have:\n\n- **Roger is Anna's ancestor.**\n- **Roger is Linda's descendant.**\n- So Anna is **descended from Roger**.\n\n- **Natalie is Kathryn's descendant.**\n- **Natalie is Shirley's ancestor.**\n\nIs **Roger** connected to **Natalie**?\n\nLet’s see if Roger appears in Kathryn’s lineage.\n\nFrom earlier, we traced Kathryn → Natalie → Shirley → Karen → Marilyn → Jose → Steven → Sara → Maria → Kenneth → Kyle → Brittany → Sharon → Joyce → Beverly → Bradley → Rebecca → Denise → Tyler → Janice → Wayne → Margaret → Brenda → Anthony → Jacob → Charlotte → Lori → Barbara → Kathleen → Cynthia → Juan → Amanda → Ronald → Jesse → Pamela → Donald → Katherine → Virginia → Nicole → Joshua → Vincent → Jessica → Sarah → Michelle → Judy → Richard → Heather → Jordan → Gabriel → Madison → Alice → Austin → Willie → Charles → Julie → Danielle → Kevin → Elizabeth → Sophia → Olivia → James → Ethan → Joseph → George → Cheryl → Walter → Teresa → Douglas → Julia → Billy → Frances → Lawrence → Dennis → Carol → Jean → Megan → John → Nancy → Lauren → Gregory → Alexander → Christina → Hannah → Ralph → Laura → Jonathan → Donna → Joan → Daniel → Jacqueline → Diana → Kimberly → Samantha → Brian → Christopher → Harold → Nicholas → Betty → Ashley → William → Emily → Janet → Stephen → Roy → Benjamin → Thomas → Jerry → Martha → Deborah → Helen → Mason → Susan → Dylan → Diane → Doris → Alan → Grace → Mary → Keith → Catherine → Jennifer → Patrick → Philip → Zachary → Paul → Michael → Scott → Joe → Gary → Bryan → Peter → Bruce → Stephanie → Robert → Noah → Jason → Gerald → Dorothy → Patricia → Sean → Andrea → Marie → Ryan → Andrew → Victoria → Kayla → Jeremy → Eugene → Matthew → Bobby → Nathan → Albert → Kelly → Raymond → Russell → Mark → Alexis → Randy → Frank → Jack → Evelyn → Ann → Rachel → Gloria → Debra → Elijah → Amber → Christian → Arthur → Ruth → Edward → Judith → David → Amy → Isabella → Samuel → Larry → Brandon → Abigail → Henry → Adam → Justin → Eric → Terry → Theresa → Sandra → Logan → Aaron → Melissa → Linda → Roger → Anna\n\nSo this is a **cycle?** Wait, that can't be. But notice:\n\nWe went from **Kathryn** all the way through a long chain and ended up at **Roger → Anna**.\n\nThat would imply that **Anna is a descendant of Kathryn**?\n\nLet’s verify the direction.\n\nWe started at **Kathryn**  \n→ **Natalie** (Kathryn is Natalie's ancestor)  \n→ **Shirley** (Natalie is Shirley's ancestor)  \n→ ...  \n→ **Roger**  \n→ **Anna**\n\nBut we must be careful with direction.\n\nGiven:  \n- \"Natalie is Kathryn's descendant.\" → So **Kathryn → ... → Natalie** (Kathryn is ancestor of Natalie)\n\n- \"Natalie is Shirley's ancestor.\" → **Natalie → ... → Shirley**\n\nSo: **Kathryn → Natalie → Shirley → ...**\n\nWe followed the **ancestor → descendant** direction.\n\nAt the end, we reached **Roger → Anna**, and we know **Roger is Anna's ancestor**, so **Roger → ... → Anna**\n\nSo the full chain is:\n\n**Kathryn → Natalie → Shirley → ... → Roger → Anna**\n\nThat would mean **Kathryn is an ancestor of Anna**, so **Anna is Kathryn's descendant**.\n\nBut is this chain valid? Did we ever reverse direction incorrectly?\n\nLet’s check a few links in the middle.\n\nWe had:  \n... → **Deborah → Helen**  \nBut given: \"Helen is Deborah's descendant.\" → So **Deborah → Helen** (correct)\n\n\"Helen is Mason's ancestor.\" → **Helen → Mason**\n\n\"Mason is Susan's ancestor.\" → **Mason → Susan**\n\n\"Susan is Dylan's ancestor.\" → **Susan → Dylan**\n\n\"Diane is Dylan's descendant.\" → **Dylan → Diane**\n\nBut we wrote: **Dylan → Diane**, but then we said **Diane → Doris**, but given: \"Diane is Doris's ancestor.\" → **Diane → Doris** (ok)\n\n\"Doris is Alan's ancestor.\" → **Doris → Alan**\n\n\"Grace is Alan's descendant.\" → **Alan → Grace**\n\n\"Grace is Mary's ancestor.\" → **Grace → Mary**\n\n\"Keith is Mary's descendant.\" → **Mary → Keith**\n\n\"Keith is Catherine's ancestor.\" → **Keith → Catherine**\n\n\"Catherine is Jennifer's ancestor.\" → **Catherine → Jennifer**\n\n\"Patrick is Jennifer's descendant.\" → **Jennifer → Patrick**\n\n\"Patrick is Philip's ancestor.\" → **Patrick → Philip**\n\n\"Zachary is Philip's descendant.\" → **Philip → Zachary**\n\n\"Zachary is Paul's ancestor.\" → **Zachary → Paul**\n\n\"Michael is Paul's descendant.\" → **Paul → Michael**\n\n\"Michael is Scott's ancestor.\" → **Michael → Scott**\n\nWait!
