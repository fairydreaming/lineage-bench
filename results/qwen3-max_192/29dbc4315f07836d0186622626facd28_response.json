**Billy is Judith's ancestor.** → Billy → Judith → ... → Alexis\n- **Jeremy is Billy's ancestor.** → Jeremy → Billy → ... → Alexis\n\nWait! Earlier we had:\n- **Jeremy is Melissa's descendant.** → Melissa → Jeremy\nBut now we also have:\n- **Jeremy is Billy's ancestor.** → Jeremy → Billy → ... → Alexis\n\nSo Jeremy appears in both lines. That suggests a possible loop or cross-connection, but more likely just that Jeremy appears in two roles (which is possible if the data is consistent). But we don't need to resolve all that.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's trace **Christian**'s lineage:\n\n- **Virginia is Christian's descendant.**\n- **Melissa is Virginia's descendant.**\n- **Jeremy is Melissa's descendant.**\n\nSo: **Christian → Virginia → Melissa → Jeremy**\n\nFrom earlier, we also have:\n- **Jeremy is Billy's ancestor.** → Jeremy → Billy → Judith → Vincent → Nathan → Betty → Jean → Jack → Austin → Janice → Gabriel → Rebecca → John → Daniel → Margaret → Teresa → Albert → Amber → Bruce → Jacqueline → Kyle → Sara → Wayne → Kathryn → Michael → Alan → Henry → Megan → Sean → George → Debra → Gerald → Walter → Denise → Eric → Mark → Shirley → Dennis → Ralph → Theresa → Judy → Frank → Charles → Justin → Edward → Harold → Carolyn → Sandra → Charlotte → Helen → Philip → Janet → William → Laura → Alexander → Olivia → Kathleen → Heather → Marie → Brittany → Logan → Ryan → Noah → Anthony → Natalie → Carol → Roger → Diana → Robert → Samuel → Deborah → Marilyn → Andrea → Cheryl → Joshua → Arthur → Donald → Frances → Lisa → Stephen → Alice → Dorothy → Patrick → Elizabeth → Julia → Victoria → Catherine → Adam → Kayla → Susan → Mary → Evelyn → Gary → Linda → Bradley → Kenneth → Barbara → Ethan → Paul → Andrew → Jose → Russell → Joseph → Thomas → Sharon → Ann → Beverly → Donna → Jason → Brandon → Juan → Pamela → Joan → Abigail → Christopher → James → Jordan → Jonathan → Joe → Michelle → Amanda → Jessica → Eugene → Sophia → Jennifer → Kelly → Carl → Aaron → Sarah → Diane → Lauren → Maria → Ronald → Benjamin → Bobby → Gregory → Ruth → Isabella → Nicole → Mason → Anna → Matthew → Christina → Emma → Rachel → Scott → Joyce → Brenda → Randy → Tyler → David → Zachary → Larry → Jerry → Amy → Patricia → Raymond → Cynthia → Kevin → Christine → Nancy → Ashley → Bryan → Elijah → Grace → Lawrence → Lori → Jacob → Jeffrey → Emily → Peter → Doris → Nicholas → Samantha → Richard → Hannah → Karen → Roy → Steven → Terry → Angela → Willie → Gloria → Timothy → Madison → Kimberly → Katherine → Alexis\n\nSo **Christian → ... → Jeremy → ... → Alexis**\n\nThus, **Christian is an ancestor of Alexis**, or **Alexis is a descendant of Christian**.\n\nWait! Let's double-check the direction:\n\n- Christian → Virginia (Virginia is Christian's descendant) → Melissa (Melissa is Virginia's descendant) → Jeremy (Jeremy is Melissa's descendant)\n\nSo: **Christian → Virginia → Melissa → Jeremy**\n\nThen: **Jeremy → Billy → ... → Alexis**\n\nSo the full chain is: **Christian → ... → Jeremy → ... → Alexis**\n\nTherefore, **Alexis is a descendant of Christian**.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n**1. Alexis is Christian's descendant.**\n\nBut wait!
