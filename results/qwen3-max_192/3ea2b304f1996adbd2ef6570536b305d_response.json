**Robert**?\n\nLet’s double-check that path.\n\nFrom **Jesse → Joshua → Terry → Alan → Abigail → Virginia → Bradley → Sean → Frances → Alexander → Stephen → Heather → Emily → Jacob → Nicholas → Gabriel → Justin → Marilyn → Barbara → Andrea → Margaret → Gloria → Gary → Shirley → Emma → Ethan → Maria → Melissa → Madison → Dorothy → Carl → Joe → Deborah → Douglas → George → Alexis → Lawrence → Kevin → Randy → Helen → Jeremy → Jose → Lori → Lauren → Rebecca → Donald → Nathan → Michael → Henry → Michelle → Philip → Dennis → Stephanie → Jason → Willie → Adam → Kathryn → Kathleen → Bruce → Billy → Kimberly → Brandon → Cynthia → Edward → Eric → Zachary → Roy → Isabella → Ashley → Aaron → Jennifer → Catherine → Andrew → Beverly → Joyce → Judith → Carolyn → Nicole → Amanda → Nancy → Dylan → Martha → Anthony → Paul → Kyle → Betty → Danielle → Bobby → Mark → Denise → John → Peter → Megan → Jonathan → Julie → Noah → Kayla → Hannah → Cheryl → Frank → Debra → Victoria → Gerald → Charles → Mary → Olivia → Anna → Brittany → Tyler → Christian → Ralph → Keith → Gregory → Richard → Brenda → Susan → Jack → Matthew → Albert → Laura → Teresa → Timothy → Julia → Bryan → Amy → Brian → Ruth → Pamela → Walter → Roger → Wayne → Sandra → Grace → Sophia → Carol → Jeffrey → Elijah → Judy → Patricia → Karen → Larry → Sharon → Angela → David → Linda → Harold → Sarah → Natalie → Sara → Patrick → Jean → Ronald → Christine → Logan → Katherine → Kelly → Rachel → Diana → Austin → Russell → Samuel → Arthur → Samantha → Marie → James → Jerry → Daniel → Amber → Lisa → Jessica → Christopher → Doris → Scott → Joseph → William → Benjamin → Janice → Elizabeth → Raymond → Jacqueline → Jordan → Vincent → Juan → Diane → Ann → Theresa → Kenneth → Steven → Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nYes! This is a **single continuous chain** from **Jesse** all the way to **Eugene**, where each step is supported by a given relationship (either direct ancestor or descendant, and we're following the direction properly).\n\nLet’s verify directionality:\n\n- **Jesse is Joshua's ancestor.** → So Joshua is a descendant of Jesse.\n- **Terry is Joshua's descendant.** → So Terry is further down (descendant of Jesse).\n- **Terry is Alan's ancestor.** → Alan is descendant of Terry → still descendant of Jesse.\n- Continue: every step is either \"X is Y's ancestor\" (so Y is descendant of X) or \"X is Y's descendant\" (so X is descendant of Y). We must ensure we are always going **downward** (from ancestor to descendant) along the chain.\n\nBut here's a potential issue: when we see \"X is Y's descendant\", that means **Y is X's ancestor**. So if we're going from Jesse downward, and we hit a statement like \"Terry is Joshua's descendant\", that’s consistent: Joshua → Terry (Terry is further down).\n\nBut later, for example: **\"Robert is Charlotte's descendant.\"** That means **Charlotte is Robert's ancestor**.\n\nBut earlier we had: **Evelyn is Charlotte's ancestor** → so Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nSo the chain is: ... → Evelyn → Charlotte → Robert → Eugene.\n\nNow, from Jesse’s side, we eventually reached **Evelyn** via:\n\n... → Steven → Evelyn.\n\nAnd **Kenneth is Steven's ancestor**, **Theresa is Kenneth's ancestor**, etc.\n\nBut wait: from Jesse we went through a very long path and eventually reached **Theresa**, then **Kenneth**, then **Steven**, then **Evelyn**, then **Charlotte**, then **Robert**, then **Eugene**.\n\nSo **Jesse is an ancestor of Eugene**, because the entire chain goes from Jesse down to Eugene.\n\nBut let's double-check a few critical links for direction:\n\n- **Jesse is
