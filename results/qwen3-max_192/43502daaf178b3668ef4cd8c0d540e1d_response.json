Douglas is Angela's ancestor.\n2. Douglas and Angela share a common descendant.\n3. Douglas is Angela's descendant.\n4. Douglas and Angela share a common ancestor.\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract relevant facts involving Douglas and Angela.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- **Scott is Douglas's descendant.** → So Douglas is Scott’s **ancestor**.\n- **Sarah is Angela's ancestor.** → So Angela is Sarah’s **descendant**.\n- **Sarah is Elijah's descendant.** → So Sarah is a **descendant** of Elijah → Elijah is Sarah’s **ancestor**.\n- **Elijah is Karen's descendant.** → So Karen is Elijah’s **ancestor**.\n- **Jessica is Karen's ancestor.** → So Jessica is an ancestor of Karen → thus also of Elijah, Sarah, and Angela.\n- **Ann is Jessica's ancestor.** → So Ann is an ancestor of Jessica → thus of Angela.\n- **William is Ann's ancestor.** → So William is an ancestor of Ann → thus of Angela.\n- **Emma is William's ancestor.** → So Emma is an ancestor of William → thus of Angela.\n\nSo Angela’s ancestors include (going upward):\n- Sarah\n- Elijah\n- Karen\n- Jessica\n- Ann\n- William\n- Emma\n\nNow for Douglas:\n\n- **Scott is Douglas's descendant.** → Douglas → Scott\n- **Scott is Douglas's descendant.** (again)\n- **Scott is Carl's ancestor.** → Scott → Carl\n- **Ruth is Carl's descendant.** → Carl → Ruth\n- **Denise is Ruth's descendant.** → Ruth → Denise\n- **Jacob is Denise's ancestor.** → Jacob → Denise\n- **Jacob is Cheryl's ancestor.** → Jacob → Cheryl\n- **Cheryl is Tyler's ancestor.** → Cheryl → Tyler\n- **Tyler is Vincent's ancestor.** → Tyler → Vincent\n- **Vincent is Sharon's ancestor.** → Vincent → Sharon\n- **Sharon is Emily's ancestor.** → Sharon → Emily\n- **Emily is Carolyn's ancestor.** → Emily → Carolyn\n- **Carolyn is Andrea's ancestor.** → Carolyn → Andrea\n- **Andrea is Michael's ancestor.** → Andrea → Michael\n- **Michael is Brenda's ancestor.** → Michael → Brenda\n- **Peter is Brenda's descendant.** → Brenda → Peter\n- **Peter is Aaron's ancestor.** → Peter → Aaron\n- **Aaron is Roy's ancestor.** → Aaron → Roy\n- **Roy is Teresa's ancestor.** → Roy → Teresa\n- **Thomas is Teresa's descendant.** → Teresa → Thomas\n- **Jennifer is Thomas's descendant.** → Thomas → Jennifer\n- **Jennifer is Joan's ancestor.** → Jennifer → Joan\n- **Joan is Ronald's ancestor.** → Joan → Ronald\n- **Ronald is Alan's ancestor.** → Ronald → Alan\n- **Alan is Cynthia's ancestor.** → Alan → Cynthia\n- **Andrew is Cynthia's descendant.** → Cynthia → Andrew\n- **Andrew is Sean's ancestor.** → Andrew → Sean\n- **Sean is Christine's ancestor.** → Sean → Christine\n- **Anna is Christine's descendant.** → Christine → Anna\n\nThis is one path, but maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should build **ancestor sets** for both Douglas and Angela and see if they intersect (common ancestor), or if one is in the other's ancestor/descendant chain.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more direct path.\n\nLet’s collect **all ancestors of Douglas** (i.e., people who are ancestors of Douglas — meaning Douglas is their descendant). But we are only given statements of the form \"X is Y's ancestor\" or \"X is Y's descendant\".\n\nWe have:\n\n- **Scott is Douglas's descendant** → Douglas is Scott’s **ancestor**.\n- So any **ancestors of Douglas** would be people who are ancestors of Douglas directly or indirectly. But we are not told anyone is Douglas’s ancestor directly.\n\nSimilarly, we are not told Douglas is anyone’s ancestor except Scott.\n\nSo Douglas’s **descendants**: Scott, and then from Scott:\n- Scott is Carl's ancestor → Carl is descendant of Scott → so Carl is **descendant of Douglas**.\n- Ruth is Carl's descendant → Ruth is descendant of Douglas.\n- Denise is Ruth's descendant → Denise is descendant of Douglas.\n- Jacob is Denise's ancestor → So Jacob is **ancestor** of Denise → is Jacob related to Douglas? Possibly, but not necessarily in the upward direction from Douglas.\n\nWait: If Denise is a descendant of Douglas, and Jacob is an ancestor of Denise, that doesn't make Jacob a descendant or ancestor of Douglas unless the path connects.\n\nBut actually, if Douglas → Scott → Carl → Ruth → Denise, and Jacob → Denise, then Jacob is **another ancestor** of Denise. That implies that **Douglas and Jacob are co-ancestors** of Denise — so they both are ancestors of Denise, meaning **Douglas and Jacob share a common descendant (Denise)**, but that doesn't help with Angela.\n\nNow let’s look at Angela’s **descendants** — we are not told any. Only that Sarah is her ancestor.\n\nSo perhaps we should look for any **common individuals** in the ancestor/descendant chains.\n\nAlternative approach: Build **ancestor set of Angela** and **descendant set of Douglas**, and see if there's overlap (which would mean Douglas is an ancestor of Angela). Or build **ancestor set of Douglas** and **descendant set of Angela**, and see if overlap (Douglas is a descendant of Angela). Or build **ancestor sets of both** and see if they intersect (common ancestor). Or build **descendant sets of both** and see if they intersect (common descendant).\n\nGiven the data, it's easier to build **ancestor sets** by following \"X is Y's ancestor\" → Y has ancestor X, and recursively, ancestors of X are also ancestors of Y.\n\nSimilarly, \"X is Y's descendant\" → Y is X's ancestor.\n\nWe can convert all statements into a directed graph where an edge A → B means A is an **ancestor** of B (i.e., A → B = A is ancestor of B = B is descendant of A).\n\nSo from each statement:\n\n- \"Sean is Christine's ancestor.\" → Sean → Christine\n- \"Austin is Sara's ancestor.\" →

Carl\n- Carl → Ruth\n- Ruth → Denise\n- Denise → Jacob (since \"Jacob is Denise's descendant\" → Denise → Jacob)\n\nWait! Hold on: The statement is **\"Jacob is Denise's descendant.\"** → So Denise → Jacob.\n\nBut earlier we had \"Jacob is Cheryl's ancestor.\" → Jacob → Cheryl.\n\nSo Denise → Jacob → Cheryl → Tyler → Vincent → Sharon → Emily → Carolyn → Andrea → Michael → Brenda → Peter → Aaron → Roy → Teresa → Thomas → Jennifer → Joan → Ronald → Alan → Cynthia → Andrew → Sean → Christine → Anna → Pamela → Kenneth → Mark → Margaret → Marilyn → Shirley → Walter → Jeremy → Keith → Raymond → Danielle → Grace → Kimberly → Frank → Charles → Kayla → Austin → Sara → Alexis → George → Dennis → Steven → Eric → Megan → Jesse → Donald → Adam → Christina → Frances → Melissa → Donna → Sophia → Judy → Anthony → Gabriel → Paul → Theresa → Joyce → Ryan → Sandra → Kevin → Amanda → Amber → Samantha → Janice → Lawrence → Edward → Jordan → Helen → Lori → Harold → Robert → Arthur → Henry → Lisa → Ashley → Martha → Mason → Zachary → Eugene → Joe → Timothy → Dorothy → Linda → Gloria → Bryan → Russell → Debra → James → Nicholas → Elizabeth → Jose → Deborah → Jonathan → Hannah → Bruce → Brian → Gregory → Christian → Ethan → Judith → Larry → Kelly → Kathryn → Catherine → Victoria → Gary → Alexander → Stephen → Julie → Kathleen → Betty → Jacqueline → Olivia → Maria → Jean → Benjamin → Randy → Noah → Mary → Madison → Ralph → Alice → Beverly → Willie → Matthew → Barbara → Amy → Dylan → Logan → Bradley → Nancy → Daniel → Bobby → Jerry → Richard → Diane → Janet → Nicole → Joshua → Patricia → Laura → Rebecca → Albert → Brittany → Nathan → Susan → Rachel → Billy → Julia → Wayne → Christopher → Jack → Virginia → Gerald → Charlotte → Samuel → Evelyn → Roger → Abigail → Heather → Diana → Justin → Isabella → Kyle → Natalie → Philip → Terry → Joseph → Juan → Jeffrey → Carol → Marie → David → Emma → William → Ann → Jessica → Karen → Elijah → Sarah → Angela\n\nWait — is this a single connected chain? It seems like many of these connect!\n\nLet’s verify a critical link:\n\nFrom **Douglas → Scott → Carl → Ruth → Denise → Jacob → Cheryl → Tyler → Vincent → Sharon → Emily → Carolyn → Andrea → Michael → Brenda → Peter → Aaron → Roy → Teresa → Thomas → Jennifer → Joan → Ronald → Alan → Cynthia → Andrew → Sean → Christine → Anna → Pamela → Kenneth → Mark → Margaret → Marilyn → Shirley → Walter →

→ Arthur → Henry → Lisa → Ashley → Martha → Mason → Zachary → Eugene → Joe → Timothy → Dorothy → Linda → Gloria → Bryan → Russell → Debra → James → Nicholas → Elizabeth → Jose → Deborah → Jonathan →

Abigail → Heather → Diana → Justin → Isabella → Kyle → Natalie → Philip → Terry → Joseph → Juan → Jeffrey → Carol → Marie → David → Emma → William → Ann → Jessica → Karen → Elijah → Sarah → Angela\n\nIf this entire chain is valid, then **Douglas is an ancestor of Angela**, because we have a directed path from Douglas to Angela through all these links.\n\nBut we must double-check the direction of each link.\n\nLet’s verify a few key transitions:\n\n1. **Douglas → Scott**: Given: \"Scott is Douglas's descendant.\" → Douglas → Scott ✅\n\n2. **Scott → Carl**: Given: \"Scott is Carl's
