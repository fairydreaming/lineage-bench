ancestor of Zachary**, and following the chain above, **Catherine is an ancestor of Patricia**.\n\nWait — let's double-check direction:\n\nWe have:\n- Catherine → Zachary (Catherine is Zachary's ancestor)\n- Zachary → Olivia (Olivia is Zachary's descendant) → Scott → ... → Patricia\n\nSo yes, **Catherine is an ancestor of Patricia**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**4.
