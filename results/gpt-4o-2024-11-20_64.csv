### Step 1: Trace Julie's lineage
- Lauren is Julie's descendant.
- Zachary is Lauren's ancestor.
- Steven is Zachary's ancestor.
- Aaron is Steven's ancestor.
- Karen is Aaron's ancestor.
- Karen is Albert's ancestor.

### Bradley's Lineage:
1. **Elizabeth is Bradley's ancestor.**
   - Elizabeth is a descendant of **Brenda**.
   - Brenda is a descendant of **Bryan**.
   - Bryan is a descendant of **Jean**.
   - Jean is a descendant of **Judith**.
   - Judith is a descendant of **Kyle**.
   - Kyle is a descendant of **Zachary**.

1. **Diana's lineage**:
   - Cheryl is Diana's ancestor.
   - Deborah is Cheryl's ancestor.
   - Anna is Deborah's ancestor.
   - Hannah is Anna's ancestor.

   Therefore, Diana's lineage traces back to Hannah.

### Step 1: Trace Julia's lineage
- Julia is a descendant of **Matthew** (Matthew → Julia).
- Matthew is a descendant of **Thomas** (Thomas → Matthew → Julia).
- Thomas is a descendant of **Bradley** (Bradley → Thomas → Matthew → Julia).
- Bradley is a descendant of **Terry** (Terry → Bradley → Thomas → Matthew → Julia).
- Terry is a descendant of **Christian** (Christian → Terry → Bradley → Thomas → Matthew → Julia).

Thus, Julia's lineage traces back to **Christian**.

### Step 2: Trace Brenda's lineage
- Brenda is a descendant of **Carol** (Carol → Brenda).
- Carol is a descendant of **Diane** (Diane → Carol → Brenda).
- Diane is a descendant of **Adam** (Adam → Diane → Carol → Brenda).
- Adam is a descendant of **Susan** (Susan → Adam → Diane → Carol → Brenda).
- Susan is a descendant of **Jennifer** (Jennifer → Susan → Adam → Diane → Carol → Brenda).
- Jennifer is a descendant of **Logan** (Logan → Jennifer → Susan → Adam → Diane → Carol → Brenda).
- Logan is a descendant of **George** (George → Logan → Jennifer → Susan → Adam → Diane → Carol → Brenda).
- George is a descendant of **Alexis** (Alexis → George → Logan → Jennifer → Susan → Adam → Diane → Carol → Brenda).
- Alexis is a descendant of **Deborah** (Deborah → Alexis → George → Logan → Jennifer → Susan → Adam → Diane → Carol → Brenda).
- Deborah is a descendant of **Joshua** (Joshua → Deborah → Alexis → George → Logan → Jennifer → Susan → Adam → Diane → Carol → Brenda).
- Joshua is a descendant of **Teresa** (Teresa → Joshua → Deborah → Alexis → George → Logan → Jennifer → Susan → Adam → Diane → Carol → Brenda).
- Teresa is a descendant of **Gary** (Gary → Teresa → Joshua → Deborah → Alexis → George → Logan → Jennifer → Susan → Adam → Diane → Carol → Brenda).

Thus, Brenda's lineage traces back to **Gary**.

### Step 3: Compare lineages
- Julia's lineage traces back to **Christian**.
- Brenda's lineage traces back to **Gary**.
- There is no indication in the given relationships that **Christian** and **Gary** are connected, either as ancestors or descendants.
