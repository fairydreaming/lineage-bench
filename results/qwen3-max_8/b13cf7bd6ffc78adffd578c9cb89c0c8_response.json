Let's break them down and build a family tree (or at least a partial ancestry/descendant graph) to determine the relationship between **Donna** and **Cheryl**.\n\n---\n\n### Given statements:\n\n1. **Joshua is Sandra's descendant.**  \n   → Sandra → ... → Joshua\n\n2. **Sandra is Katherine's descendant.**  \n   → Katherine → ... → Sandra → ... → Joshua\n\n3. **Ronald is Katherine's ancestor.**  \n   → Ronald → ... → Katherine → ... → Sandra → ... → Joshua\n\n4. **Walter is Joshua's descendant.**  \n   → Joshua → ... → Walter\n\n5. **Ronald is Matthew's ancestor.**  \n   → Ronald → ... → Matthew\n\n6. **Walter is Donna's ancestor.**  \n   → Walter → ... → Donna\n\n7. **Cheryl is Matthew's descendant.**  \n   → Matthew → ... → Cheryl\n\n---\n\n### Let's trace ancestry paths:\n\nFrom (3) and (5):  \n- **Ronald** is an ancestor of **both Katherine and Matthew**.  \nSo **Katherine** and **Matthew** are (at least) distant cousins or possibly siblings, but definitely share **Ronald** as a common ancestor.\n\nFrom (2) and (1):  \n- **Katherine → Sandra → Joshua**\n\nFrom (4):  \n- **Joshua → Walter**\n\nFrom (6):  \n- **Walter → Donna**\n\nSo full line:  \n**Katherine → Sandra → Joshua → Walter → Donna**\n\nFrom (5) and (7):  \n- **Ronald → ... → Matthew → Cheryl**\n\nAnd from (3):  \n- **Ronald → ... → Katherine → ... → Donna**\n\nSo both **Donna** and **Cheryl** descend from **Ronald**.\n\nThus, **Donna and Cheryl share a common ancestor: Ronald**.\n\nNow check if any more specific relationship exists (e.g., is one ancestor of the other?):\n\n- Donna’s ancestry: Donna ← Walter ← Joshua ← Sandra ← Katherine ← ... ← Ronald  \n- Cheryl’s ancestry: Cheryl ← Matthew ← ... ← Ronald\n\nThere is **no indication** that Matthew is in the line of Katherine (or vice versa).
