Lineage Relationships**\n\nI'm currently focused on parsing a complex dataset of familial connections. My aim is to build a suitable data structure - likely a graph or family tree - to represent the parental links between individuals. This visual representation will be key to uncovering the lineage between Janet and Rebecca, with the goal of visualizing the precise steps needed.\n\n\n**Deducing Ancestral Connections**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now working through a list of relationships to build out the full ancestral network. I'm focusing on parsing the given statements into a consistent format, likely using arrow notation. I'm noting specific individuals connected by an 'is an ancestor of' relationship. My next step will be to look for potential links and build out the family graph in greater detail.\n\n\n**Extending Family Networks**\n\n\\n\\nI've now incorporated the provided relationships into the growing family graph. Each statement has been converted into arrow notation, directly adding new connections. I'm actively expanding the network, adding descendants like Kevin and Thomas, and ancestors like Eric and Susan, based on the provided connections. I'm making progress in making these connections.\n\n\n**Incorporating Additional Lineages**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now integrating new familial data into my family graph. Each relationship, from Alice and Helen to Sandra and Shirley, is being converted into arrow notation and added. This expansion enriches the network, allowing me to draw new connections. I'm building it up, person by person.\n\n\n**Building Complex Lineages**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now processing the latest familial connections.
