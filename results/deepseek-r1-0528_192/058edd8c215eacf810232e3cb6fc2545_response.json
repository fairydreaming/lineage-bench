Specifically, Kimberly is a descendant of both Joe and Roy through the following paths:\n\n- **Path from Joe to Kimberly**:  \n  Joe → Roger → Russell → Jacob → Anthony → Aaron → Ethan → Theresa → Julie → Diane → Noah → Rebecca → Amy → Cynthia → Philip → Ryan → Austin → Donald → Gabriel → Donna → Christine → Elizabeth → Steven → Deborah → Joseph → Frances → Judith → Kyle → David → Julia → Jean → Charlotte → Ronald → Walter → Helen → Nicholas → Jesse → Carolyn → Ann → Margaret → Kevin → Laura → Jose → Larry → Bobby → Nicole → Alexander → Jeremy → Pamela → Sarah → Megan → Ashley → Charles → James → Alice → Arthur → Gregory → Janet → Isabella → Abigail → Sean → Christian → Bradley → Wayne → Nathan → Danielle → Harold → Daniel → Samuel → Andrew → Jordan → Brian → Patricia → Anna → Madison → Susan → Brenda → Mason → Carl → Stephen → Betty → Henry → Jason → Bryan → Victoria → Jennifer → Benjamin → Willie → Joyce → Judy → Eric → Alexis → Randy → Douglas → Jonathan → Gary → Alan → Kathleen → Nancy → Emily → Peter → Denise → Debra → John → Elijah → Katherine → Marie → Heather → Andrea → Beverly → Melissa → Robert → Albert → Kelly → Lauren → Amanda → Natalie → Tyler → Teresa → Maria → Christopher → Lisa → Michael → Zachary → Dorothy → Frank → Dennis → Rachel → Jerry → Michelle → Ruth → Lawrence → Sara → Jack → Timothy → Amber → Samantha → Mark → Lori → Cheryl → Dylan → Ralph → Sharon → Shirley → Gerald → Matthew → William → Juan → Brandon → Sandra → Joshua → Catherine → Logan → Diana → Evelyn → George → Martha → Eugene → Terry → Scott → Doris → Marilyn → Emma → Jacqueline → Kathryn → Olivia → Hannah → Joan → Bruce → Barbara → Richard → Christina → Patrick → Paul → Jeffrey → Virginia → Linda → Mary → Adam → Stephanie → Janice → Gloria → Kenneth → Edward → Thomas → Raymond → Billy → Vincent → Kimberly\n\n- **Path from Roy to Kimberly**:  \n  Roy → Justin → Sophia → Kimberly  \n  (Roy is Justin's ancestor, Justin is Sophia's ancestor via Sophia being Justin's descendant, and Sophia is Kimberly's ancestor via Kimberly being Sophia's descendant.)\n\nSince Kimberly is a descendant of both Joe and Roy, they share a common descendant. None of the other options apply:\n- Joe is not Roy's ancestor or descendant, as there is no direct or indirect path indicating such a relationship.\n- They do not share a common ancestor, as no such ancestor is identified in the relationships.\n\nThus, the correct relationship is that Joe and Roy share a common descendant.\n\n<ANSWER>4</ANSWER>","refusal":null,"reasoning":"First, I need to determine the lineage relationship between Joe and Roy based on all these given relationships. The options are:\n\n1. Joe is Roy's ancestor.\n\n2. Joe and Roy share a common ancestor.\n\n3. Joe is Roy's descendant.\n\n4. Joe and Roy share a common descendant.\n\n5. None of the above.\n\nI should start by listing all the relevant relationships that involve Joe or Roy, and then see if I can connect them through the other people mentioned.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- Roy is Justin's ancestor.\n\nAnd for Joe:\n\n- Joe is Roger's ancestor.\n\nI need to find a path between Joe and Roy using the other lineage connections.\n\nI should build a family tree or a graph to connect all these people. Since there are many, I might need to find a chain that links Joe to Roy.\n\nLet me list all the relationships again for reference. I'll group them by the type (ancestor or descendant) to make it easier.\n\nFirst, I'll extract all statements and note who is whose ancestor or descendant.\n\n- Kathryn is Jacqueline's descendant.

Roy is ancestor of Justin, Joe is ancestor of Sophia, and Sophia is descendant of Justin, so Justin is between them.\n\nSpecifically, Roy is an ancestor of Justin, and Justin is an ancestor of Sophia, and Sophia is a descendant of Joe through the long chain.\n\nTherefore, Joe is an ancestor of Sophia, and Roy is an ancestor of Justin, who is an ancestor of Sophia, so Joe and Roy are both ancestors of Sophia, meaning they share a common descendant, Sophia.\n\nOption 4 is \"Joe and Roy share a common descendant.\"\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me verify the connection.\n\nFirst, Roy → Justin → Sophia\n\nFrom the list: Roy → Justin, and Justin → Sophia (Sophia is Justin's descendant)\n\nNow, from Joe to Sophia: Joe → Roger → ... → Sophia\n\nIn my chain, I have Kimberly → Sophia?

In the chain, I ended with Sophia being descendant, but in the path, Sophia is an ancestor in some parts? No, in the lineage, when we say A is B's descendant, it means B → A.\n\nIn the chain above, from Joe to Sophia, it's all descendant paths: Joe → Roger → Russell → ... and eventually to Sophia? In the last part, I have Sophia → Kimberly, but Sophia is the starting point for that, but in the context, Sophia is a person.\n\nLet's see where Sophia appears.\n\nIn the chain from Joe, I have Justin → Sophia as part of the path? No.\n\nIn my initial derivation, I have from Joe to ... to Rebecca → Amy → ... then later Kimberly → Vincent, and Kimberly is Sophia's descendant, so Sophia → Kimberly.\n\nBut Sophia is not directly in the Joe to Kimberly path; Sophia is an ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nSimilarly, Sophia is a descendant of Justin: Justin → Sophia.\n\nAnd Roy → Justin.\n\nFor Joe, we need Joe to be an ancestor of Sophia.\n\nIn the path, Joe → Roger → ... let's find how Sophia is connected.\n\nFrom Joe, through the chain, I ended with Kimberly who is descendant of Sophia, so Sophia is an ancestor of Kimberly, but Joe is also ancestor of Kimberly through the chain.\n\nBut for Sophia, Joe is an ancestor of Kimberly, who is descendant of Sophia, so Sophia is ancestor of Kimberly, Joe is ancestor of Kimberly, so they share common descendant Kimberly, but Sophia is not necessarily related directly to Joe in that sense.\n\nI think I confused the direction.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nSuppose we have Joe → A → B → ... → Kimberly\n\nAnd Sophia → Kimberly\n\nSo Kimberly is descendant of both Joe and Sophia.\n\nSimilarly, Roy → Justin → Sophia, so Sophia is descendant of both Roy and Justin.\n\nTherefore, Kimberly is a common descendant of Joe and Sophia, and Sophia is a common descendant of Roy and Justin.\n\nBut for Joe and Roy, they both have Kimberly as a descendant?

How?\n\nFrom Joe to Sophia: if we go from Joe down, we get to Kimberly, who has Sophia as ancestor, so Sophia is not descendant of Joe; Sophia is ancestor of Kimberly, who is descendant of Joe.\n\nTherefore, Sophia is not a descendant of Joe; rather, Joe is ancestor of descendants of Sophia.\n\nBut for common descendant, Kimberly works.\n\nRoy is ancestor of Sophia, and Sophia is ancestor of Kimberly, so Roy is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nJoe is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTo have Sophia as common descendant, we need Joe to be ancestor of Sophia.\n\nFrom the chain, is there a path?\n\nFor example, from Sophia, we have Justin → Sophia, and Justin has ancestors.\n\nBut Roy is one, but Joe is not directly.\n\nSince Kimberly is Sophia's descendant, and Joe is Kimberly's ancestor, but Sophia is not descendant of Joe.\n\nUnless there is a path from Joe to Sophia.\n\nIn the list, Sophia is Justin's descendant, and Justin might be connected.\n\nBut from Joe, I don't see Justin in the chain.\n\nPerhaps I can find a shorter path.\n\nAnother approach: since Roy → Justin and Justin → Sophia, and Sophia → Kimberly.\n\nFrom Joe to Kimberly: long path.\n\nBut Kimberly is Sophia's descendant, Sophia is Justin's, Justin is Roy's.\n\nJoe to Kimberly.\n\nPerhaps Joe and Roy both lead to Sophia.\n\nBut from Joe, how to Sophia?\n\nLet's list all ancestors or descendants.\n\nFrom the relationships, we have:\n\n- Sophia is Justin's descendant: Justin → Sophia\n\n- Kimberly is Sophia's descendant: Sophia → Kimberly\n\n- Kimberly is Vincent's ancestor:

is Edward's ancestor: Thomas → Edward\n\nThomas is Raymond's descendant: Raymond → Thomas\n\nBilly is Raymond's ancestor: Billy → Raymond\n\nVincent is Billy's ancestor: Vincent → Billy\n\nKimberly is Vincent's ancestor: Kimberly → Vincent\n\nKimberly is Sophia's descendant: Sophia → Kimberly\n\nSo at this point, Sophia → Kimberly, and Kimberly is the end of the Joe chain.\n\nFor Sophia, we have Justin → Sophia.\n\nAnd Roy → Justin.\n\nTo connect Joe to Sophia, we need to go from Kimberly up to Sophia, but Sophia is ancestor, so in terms of descendants, Sophia is not descendant of Joe; Joe is ancestor of Kimberly, Sophia is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nTherefore, Joe and Sophia share a common descendant in Kimberly, but for Joe and Roy, they both are ancestors of Kimberly.\n\nRoy is ancestor of Sophia, Sophia is ancestor of Kimberly, so Roy is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nJoe is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nThus, Kimberly is a common descendant.\n\nSince Sophia is also a descendant of Roy, and if Joe were ancestor of Sophia, but he is not, based on the chain.\n\nIs there a way Joe is ancestor of Sophia?\n\nFor example, through other paths.\n\nBut from the given, I think Kimberly is the common descendant.\n\nAnother common point: Justin.\n\nJustin is descendant of Roy, and Justin is ancestor of Sophia, but Joe is not directly related to Justin.\n\nIn the chain, Sophia is connected, but Joe is not ancestor of Justin.\n\nFor instance, from Justin, who are his ancestors?\n\nRoy is one, but not Joe.\n\nSo I think the safest is that they share common descendants like Kimberly or Sophia, but Sophia is not descendant of Joe.\n\nSpecifically, for Sophia, Roy is ancestor, but Joe is not.\n\nFor Kimberly, both are ancestors.\n\nTherefore, Joe and Roy share a common descendant, Kimberly.\n\nMoreover, there might be others, but Kimberly is sufficient.\n\nSo the relationship is that they share a common descendant.\n\nHence, option 4.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer choices.\n\n1. Joe is Roy's ancestor.\n\n2. Joe and Roy share a common ancestor.\n\n3. Joe is Roy's descendant.\n\n4. Joe and Roy share a common descendant.\n\n5. None.\n\nFrom above, not 1,2,3, but 4 seems correct.\n\nIs there a possibility of common ancestor?\n\nFor example, do Joe and Roy have a common ancestor?\n\nJoe is Roger's ancestor, but Roger might have ancestors not listed.\n\nSimilarly, Roy might have ancestors.\n\nBut from the information, we don't have any common ancestor specified.\n\nFor instance, we might find one, but it's not necessary.\n\nIn this case, since we found a common descendant, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can see if they are directly related.\n\nBut I think sharing a common descendant is the conclusion.\n\nSo I think the answer is 4.\n","reasoning_details":[{"format":null,"index":0,"type":"reasoning.text","text":"First, I need to determine the lineage relationship between Joe and Roy based on all these given relationships.

Roy is ancestor of Justin, Joe is ancestor of Sophia, and Sophia is descendant of Justin, so Justin is between them.\n\nSpecifically, Roy is an ancestor of Justin, and Justin is an ancestor of Sophia, and Sophia is a descendant of Joe through the long chain.\n\nTherefore, Joe is an ancestor of Sophia, and Roy is an ancestor of Justin, who is an ancestor of Sophia, so Joe and Roy are both ancestors of Sophia, meaning they share a common descendant, Sophia.\n\nOption 4 is \"Joe and Roy share a common descendant.\"\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me verify the connection.\n\nFirst, Roy → Justin → Sophia\n\nFrom the list: Roy → Justin, and Justin → Sophia (Sophia is Justin's descendant)\n\nNow, from Joe to Sophia: Joe → Roger → ... → Sophia\n\nIn my chain, I have Kimberly → Sophia?

No, Justin is Sophia's ancestor.\n\nIn the path from Joe to Sophia, I need to go from Joe to ancestors or descendants properly.\n\nJoe is Roger's ancestor: Joe → Roger\n\nThen Roger → Russell (Russell is Roger's descendant)\n\nRussell → Jacob\n\nJacob → Anthony\n\nAnthony → Aaron\n\nAaron → Ethan\n\nEthan → Theresa (Ethan is Theresa's ancestor)\n\nTheresa → Julie\n\nJulie → Diane\n\nDiane → Noah\n\nNoah → Rebecca\n\nRebecca → Amy (Rebecca is Amy's ancestor)\n\nAmy → Cynthia\n\nCynthia → Philip\n\nPhilip → Ryan\n\nRyan → Austin\n\nAustin → Donald\n\nDonald → Gabriel\n\nGabriel → Donna\n\nDonna → Christine\n\nChristine → Elizabeth\n\nElizabeth → Steven\n\nSteven → Deborah\n\nDeborah → Joseph\n\nJoseph → Frances\n\nFrances → Judith\n\nJudith → Kyle\n\nKyle → David\n\nDavid → Julia\n\nJulia → Jean\n\nJean → Charlotte\n\nCharlotte → Ronald\n\nRonald → Walter\n\nWalter → Helen\n\nHelen → Nicholas\n\nNicholas → Jesse\n\nJesse → Carolyn\n\nCarolyn → Ann\n\nAnn → Margaret\n\nMargaret → Kevin\n\nKevin → Laura\n\nLaura → Jose\n\nJose → Larry\n\nLarry → Bobby\n\nBobby → Nicole\n\nNicole → Alexander\n\nAlexander → Jeremy\n\nJeremy → Pamela\n\nPamela → Sarah\n\nSarah → Megan\n\nMegan → Ashley\n\nAshley → Charles\n\nCharles → James\n\nJames → Alice\n\nAlice → Arthur\n\nArthur → Gregory\n\nGregory → Janet\n\nJanet → Isabella\n\nIsabella → Abigail\n\nAbigail → Sean\n\nSean → Christian\n\nChristian → Bradley\n\nBradley → Wayne\n\nWayne → Nathan\n\nNathan → Danielle\n\nDanielle → Harold\n\nHarold → Daniel\n\nDaniel → Samuel\n\nSamuel → Andrew\n\nAndrew → Jordan\n\nJordan → Brian\n\nBrian → Patricia\n\nPatricia → Anna\n\nAnna → Madison\n\nMadison → Susan\n\nSusan → Brenda\n\nBrenda → Mason\n\nMason → Carl\n\nCarl → Stephen\n\nStephen → Betty\n\nBetty → Henry\n\nHenry → Jason\n\nJason → Bryan\n\nBryan → Victoria\n\nVictoria → Jennifer\n\nJennifer → Benjamin\n\nBenjamin → Willie\n\nWillie → Joyce\n\nJoyce → Judy\n\nJudy → Eric\n\nEric → Alexis\n\nAlexis → Randy\n\nRandy → Douglas\n\nDouglas → Jonathan\n\nJonathan → Gary\n\nGary → Alan\n\nAlan → Kathleen\n\nKathleen → Nancy\n\nNancy → Emily\n\nEmily → Peter\n\nPeter → Denise\n\nDenise → Debra\n\nDebra → John\n\nJohn → Elijah\n\nElijah → Katherine\n\nKatherine → Marie\n\nMarie → Heather\n\nHeather → Andrea\n\nAndrea → Beverly\n\nBeverly → Melissa\n\nMelissa → Robert\n\nRobert → Albert\n\nAlbert → Kelly\n\nKelly → Lauren\n\nLauren → Amanda\n\nAmanda → Natalie\n\nNatalie → Tyler\n\nTyler → Teresa\n\nTeresa → Maria\n\nMaria → Christopher\n\nChristopher → Lisa\n\nLisa → Michael\n\nMichael → Zachary\n\nZachary → Dorothy\n\nDorothy → Frank\n\nFrank → Dennis\n\nDennis → Rachel\n\nRachel → Jerry\n\nJerry → Michelle\n\nMichelle → Ruth\n\nRuth → Lawrence\n\nLawrence → Sara\n\nSara → Jack\n\nJack → Timothy\n\nTimothy → Amber\n\nAmber → Samantha\n\nSamantha → Mark\n\nMark → Lori\n\nLori → Cheryl\n\nCheryl → Dylan\n\nDylan → Ralph\n\nRalph → Sharon\n\nSharon → Shirley\n\nShirley → Gerald\n\nGerald → Matthew\n\nMatthew → William\n\nWilliam → Juan\n\nJuan → Brandon\n\nBrandon → Sandra\n\nSandra → Joshua\n\nJoshua → Catherine\n\nCatherine → Logan\n\nLogan → Diana\n\nDiana → Evelyn\n\nEvelyn → George\n\nGeorge → Martha\n\nMartha → Eugene\n\nEugene → Terry\n\nTerry → Scott\n\nScott → Doris\n\nDoris → Marilyn\n\nMarilyn → Emma\n\nEmma → Jacqueline\n\nJacqueline → Kathryn\n\nKathryn → Olivia\n\nOlivia → Hannah\n\nHannah → Joan\n\nJoan → Bruce\n\nBruce → Barbara\n\nBarbara → Richard\n\nRichard → Christina\n\nChristina → Patrick\n\nPatrick → Paul\n\nPaul → Jeffrey\n\nJeffrey → Virginia\n\nVirginia → Linda\n\nLinda → Mary\n\nMary → Adam\n\nStephanie → Adam (Stephanie is Adam's ancestor, so Stephanie → Adam)\n\nJanice is Stephanie's ancestor: Janice → Stephanie\n\nJanice is Gloria's descendant: Gloria → Janice\n\nKenneth is Gloria's ancestor: Kenneth → Gloria\n\nEdward is Kenneth's ancestor: Edward → Kenneth\n\nThomas is Edward's ancestor: Thomas → Edward\n\nThomas is Raymond's descendant: Raymond → Thomas\n\nBilly is Raymond's ancestor: Billy → Raymond\n\nVincent is Billy's ancestor: Vincent → Billy\n\nKimberly is Vincent's ancestor: Kimberly → Vincent\n\nKimberly is Sophia's descendant: Sophia → Kimberly\n\nBut Sophia → Kimberly, and Kimberly → Vincent, etc.\n\nNow, Sophia is also Justin's descendant: Justin → Sophia\n\nAnd Roy → Justin\n\nSo from Sophia, we have two paths: one to Kimberly and descendants, and one to Justin and Roy.\n\nBut for the common descendant, Sophia is a descendant of both Joe and Roy.\n\nJoe is an ancestor of Sophia through the long chain, and Roy is an ancestor of Sophia through Roy → Justin → Sophia.\n\nTherefore, Sophia is a common descendant of both Joe and Roy.\n\nHence, they share a common descendant.\n\nTo confirm, is there any inconsistency?\n\nFor example, from Joe to Sophia: we have Joe → Roger → ... → Sophia? In the chain, I ended with Sophia being descendant, but in the path, Sophia is an ancestor in some parts? No, in the lineage, when we say A is B's descendant, it means B → A.\n\nIn the chain above, from Joe to Sophia, it's all descendant paths: Joe → Roger → Russell → ... and eventually to Sophia?

How?\n\nFrom Joe to Sophia: if we go from Joe down, we get to Kimberly, who has Sophia as ancestor, so Sophia is not descendant of Joe; Sophia is ancestor of Kimberly, who is descendant of Joe.\n\nTherefore, Sophia is not a descendant of Joe; rather, Joe is ancestor of descendants of Sophia.\n\nBut for common descendant, Kimberly works.\n\nRoy is ancestor of Sophia, and Sophia is ancestor of Kimberly, so Roy is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nJoe is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTo have Sophia as common descendant, we need Joe to be ancestor of Sophia.\n\nFrom the chain, is there a path?\n\nFor example, from Sophia, we have Justin → Sophia, and Justin has ancestors.\n\nBut Roy is one, but Joe is not directly.\n\nSince Kimberly is Sophia's descendant, and Joe is Kimberly's ancestor, but Sophia is not descendant of Joe.\n\nUnless there is a path from Joe to Sophia.\n\nIn the list, Sophia is Justin's descendant, and Justin might be connected.\n\nBut from Joe, I don't see Justin in the chain.\n\nPerhaps I can find a shorter path.\n\nAnother approach: since Roy → Justin and Justin → Sophia, and Sophia → Kimberly.\n\nFrom Joe to Kimberly: long path.\n\nBut Kimberly is Sophia's descendant, Sophia is Justin's, Justin is Roy's.\n\nJoe to Kimberly.\n\nPerhaps Joe and Roy both lead to Sophia.\n\nBut from Joe, how to Sophia?\n\nLet's list all ancestors or descendants.\n\nFrom the relationships, we have:\n\n- Sophia is Justin's descendant: Justin → Sophia\n\n- Kimberly is Sophia's descendant: Sophia → Kimberly\n\n- Kimberly is Vincent's ancestor:

is Edward's ancestor: Thomas → Edward\n\nThomas is Raymond's descendant: Raymond → Thomas\n\nBilly is Raymond's ancestor: Billy → Raymond\n\nVincent is Billy's ancestor: Vincent → Billy\n\nKimberly is Vincent's ancestor: Kimberly → Vincent\n\nKimberly is Sophia's descendant: Sophia → Kimberly\n\nSo at this point, Sophia → Kimberly, and Kimberly is the end of the Joe chain.\n\nFor Sophia, we have Justin → Sophia.\n\nAnd Roy → Justin.\n\nTo connect Joe to Sophia, we need to go from Kimberly up to Sophia, but Sophia is ancestor, so in terms of descendants, Sophia is not descendant of Joe; Joe is ancestor of Kimberly, Sophia is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nTherefore, Joe and Sophia share a common descendant in Kimberly, but for Joe and Roy, they both are ancestors of Kimberly.\n\nRoy is ancestor of Sophia, Sophia is ancestor of Kimberly, so Roy is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nJoe is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nThus, Kimberly is a common descendant.\n\nSince Sophia is also a descendant of Roy, and if Joe were ancestor of Sophia, but he is not, based on the chain.\n\nIs there a way Joe is ancestor of Sophia?\n\nFor example, through other paths.\n\nBut from the given, I think Kimberly is the common descendant.\n\nAnother common point: Justin.\n\nJustin is descendant of Roy, and Justin is ancestor of Sophia, but Joe is not directly related to Justin.\n\nIn the chain, Sophia is connected, but Joe is not ancestor of Justin.\n\nFor instance, from Justin, who are his ancestors?\n\nRoy is one, but not Joe.\n\nSo I think the safest is that they share common descendants like Kimberly or Sophia, but Sophia is not descendant of Joe.\n\nSpecifically, for Sophia, Roy is ancestor, but Joe is not.\n\nFor Kimberly, both are ancestors.\n\nTherefore, Joe and Roy share a common descendant, Kimberly.\n\nMoreover, there might be others, but Kimberly is sufficient.\n\nSo the relationship is that they share a common descendant.\n\nHence, option 4.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer choices.\n\n1. Joe is Roy's ancestor.\n\n2. Joe and Roy share a common ancestor.\n\n3. Joe is Roy's descendant.\n\n4. Joe and Roy share a common descendant.\n\n5. None.\n\nFrom above, not 1,2,3, but 4 seems correct.\n\nIs there a possibility of common ancestor?\n\nFor example, do Joe and Roy have a common ancestor?\n\nJoe is Roger's ancestor, but Roger might have ancestors not listed.\n\nSimilarly, Roy might have ancestors.\n\nBut from the information, we don't have any common ancestor specified.\n\nFor instance, we might find one, but it's not necessary.\n\nIn this case, since we found a common descendant, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can see if they are directly related.\n\nBut I think sharing a common descendant is the conclusion.\n\nSo I think the answer is 4.\n"}]}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1437,"total_tokens":12890,"completion_tokens":11453,"reasoning_tokens":0}}
