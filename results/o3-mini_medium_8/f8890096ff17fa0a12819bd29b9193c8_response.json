In other words, Randy and Helen come from separate branches stemming from their common ancestor, Roger.\n\nTherefore, Randy and Helen share a common ancestor.\n\n<ANSWER>4</ANSWER>","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":143,"completion_tokens":1806,"total_tokens":1949,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":1536}}}
