For example, we are told that:\n\n• Mason is Angela’s descendant, meaning Angela is older than Mason.\n• Christina is Mason’s ancestor, so Christina comes before Mason.\n• Also, on another “branch” we know that Brittany is an ancestor of Sandra, Sandra is an ancestor of Joan, and Joan is an ancestor of Sharon. In addition, Sharon is an ancestor of Diana, and Diana is an ancestor of Christina.\n\nThus, putting these chains together we get a picture similar to this (where “→” means “is an ancestor of”):\n\n Brittany → Sandra → Joan → Sharon → Diana → Christina → (…?) → Mason  \n                    +  \n Angela → Mason\n\nSince Christina is an ancestor of Mason and Mason is a descendant of Angela, Mason is in the descendant line coming from both Christina (and hence from Brittany) and from Angela. That is, Mason is a common descendant of Angela and (through Christina, via the chain starting with) Brittany.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Angela and Brittany share a common descendant.\n\n<ANSWER>4</ANSWER>","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":143,"completion_tokens":2817,"total_tokens":2960,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":2560}}}
