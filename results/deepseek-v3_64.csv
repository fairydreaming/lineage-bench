### Step 1: Identify Carol's Ancestors and Descendants
- **Carol** is mentioned in the relationship: ""Ann is Carol's descendant."" This means Carol is Ann's ancestor.

### Step 2: Identify Matthew's Ancestors and Descendants
- **Matthew** is mentioned in the relationship: ""Matthew is Joan's ancestor."" This means Matthew is Joan's ancestor.

### Step 3: Trace the Lineage
- **Carol** is the ancestor of **Ann**.
- **Matthew** is the ancestor of **Joan**.
- There is no direct or indirect relationship provided between Carol and Matthew in the given lineage relationships.
