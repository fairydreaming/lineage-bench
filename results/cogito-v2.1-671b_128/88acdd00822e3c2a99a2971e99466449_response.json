But the key point is that Robert is Natalie's ancestor, and through the chain, Natalie is connected to Thomas, and so on, eventually leading to Christine, who is Wayne's ancestor. So Robert is an ancestor of Natalie, and through the chain, Natalie's descendant is Thomas, and so on, leading to Christine, who is Wayne's ancestor. Therefore, Robert is an ancestor of Wayne.\n\nWait, let me check the direction: Robert → Natalie → Thomas → Ann → Janice → Elizabeth → Shirley → Carol → Philip → Paul → Susan → Roger → Julia → Pamela → Jacob → Danielle → Ruth → Megan → Anna → Richard → Betty → Deborah → Donald → Arthur → Patricia → Charles → Roy → Jennifer → Amy → Evelyn → Cheryl → Jean → Karen → Gary → Jason → Justin → Terry → Catherine → Jeffrey → Alexander → Doris → Barbara → Albert → Larry → Jeremy → Frances → Adam → Andrea → Timothy → Alan → Charlotte → Emily → Dorothy → Grace → Marilyn → Willie → Lawrence → Sandra → Diane → Ashley → Carolyn → Gerald → Christopher → Stephen → Hannah → Diana → Dylan → Alice → Zachary → Ralph → Mason → Abigail → Bryan → Theresa → Vincent → Kenneth → Harold → Gabriel → Brandon → Noah → Maria → Kathleen → Lauren → Emma → Joshua → Bobby → Linda → Elijah → Steven → Heather → Jesse → Kimberly → Jerry → Nicholas → Melissa → Ryan → Michael → Edward → Laura → Scott → Lisa → Kathryn → Marie → Eric → Raymond → Cynthia → Keith → Samantha → Aaron → Ethan → Billy → Kevin → Patrick → Joe → Katherine → Debra → Christian → Benjamin → Gloria → Jack → Dennis → Janet → Martha → Julie → Randy → Brian → Christine → Wayne.\n\nYes, so Robert is an ancestor of Natalie, and Natalie is an ancestor of Thomas, and so on, all the way down to Christine, who is an ancestor of Wayne. Therefore, Robert is an ancestor of Wayne.\n\nSo the relationship is that Robert is Wayne's ancestor.\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Robert and Wayne share a common descendant.\n2.
