Kimberly is Jonathan's descendant.\n\n   So, Jonathan → Kimberly (Jonathan is an ancestor of Kimberly).\n\n3. Jonathan is Donna's descendant.\n\n   So, Donna → Jonathan (Donna is an ancestor of Jonathan).\n\n4. Debra is Emma's descendant.\n\n   So, Emma → Debra (Emma is an ancestor of Debra).\n\n5.

I see that Kimberly is involved with Gary, and Kimberly is connected to Jonathan, who is connected to Donna.

So Jonathan is above Kimberly, and Kimberly is above Gary. So: Jonathan → Kimberly → Gary.\n\nFrom statement 3: Jonathan is Donna's descendant. So Donna → Jonathan. Thus, Donna → Jonathan → Kimberly → Gary.\n\nSo Donna is an ancestor of Gary.\n\nNow, from statements 5 and 6: Teresa is Emma's ancestor, and Teresa is Donna's descendant. So Donna → Teresa → Emma.\n\nFrom statement 4: Debra is Emma's descendant, so Emma → Debra.\n\nFrom statement 7: Julie is Debra's descendant, so Debra → Julie.\n\nSo putting together from Emma: Emma → Debra → Julie.\n\nAnd since Teresa → Emma, we have Teresa → Emma → Debra → Julie.\n\nAnd since Donna → Teresa, we have Donna → Teresa → Emma → Debra → Julie.\n\nSo Donna is an ancestor of Julie as well.\n\nFrom above, Donna is an ancestor of Gary: Donna → Jonathan → Kimberly → Gary.\n\nAnd Donna is an ancestor of Julie: Donna → Teresa → Emma → Debra → Julie.\n\nTherefore, Gary and Julie both have Donna as a common ancestor.\n\nSo, Gary and Julie share a common ancestor, which is Donna.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n1.

There is no direct line between Gary and Julie; they are like cousins in a family tree, sharing a common ancestor.\n\nSo, Gary is not Julie's ancestor, nor is Julie Gary's ancestor.
