That means Jerry is an ancestor of Henry.\n\nFrom point 2: Beverly is Henry's descendant. So Henry is an ancestor of Beverly.\n\nSo from Jerry to Henry to Beverly: Jerry → Henry → Beverly.\n\nNow, from point 5: Beverly is Deborah's ancestor. So Beverly → Deborah.\n\nFrom point 3: Deborah is Gerald's ancestor. So Deborah → Gerald.\n\nBut from point 7: Amber is Gerald's descendant.
