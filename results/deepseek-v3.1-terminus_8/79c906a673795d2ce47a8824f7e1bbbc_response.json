So, Noah is an ancestor of Linda.\n\n3. Jacob is Linda's descendant. So, Linda is an ancestor of Jacob.\n\n4. Jacob is Carolyn's ancestor. So, Jacob is an ancestor of Carolyn.\n\n5. Julie is Catherine's descendant. So, Catherine is an ancestor of Julie.\n\n6. Walter is Carolyn's descendant. So, Carolyn is an ancestor of Walter.\n\n7. Sara is Noah's ancestor. So, Sara is an ancestor of Noah.\n\nI need to find how Sara and Julie are related.\n\nLet me try to map this out. I'll start from the top or bottom, but I need to connect all the people.\n\nFrom point 6: Walter is Carolyn's descendant. That means Carolyn → Walter.\n\nFrom point 1: Catherine is Walter's descendant, so Walter → Catherine.\n\nFrom point 5: Julie is Catherine's descendant, so Catherine → Julie.\n\nSo, putting that together: Carolyn → Walter → Catherine → Julie.\n\nSo, Carolyn is an ancestor of Julie.\n\nNow, from point 4: Jacob is Carolyn's ancestor, so Jacob → Carolyn.\n\nBut from point 3: Jacob is Linda's descendant, so Linda → Jacob.\n\nFrom point 2: Noah is Linda's ancestor, so Noah → Linda.\n\nFrom point 7: Sara is Noah's ancestor, so Sara → Noah.\n\nSo, putting that together: Sara → Noah → Linda → Jacob → Carolyn.\n\nAnd since Carolyn → Walter → Catherine → Julie, we have Sara → Noah → Linda → Jacob → Carolyn → Walter → Catherine → Julie.\n\nTherefore, Sara is an ancestor of Julie.\n\nSo, Sara is Julie's ancestor.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n1. Sara is Julie's ancestor. This seems correct.\n\n2. Sara and Julie share a common descendant. Well, since Sara is an ancestor, they might share descendants, but Julie is a descendant of Sara, so they share Julie as a descendant, but that's not typically how it's phrased. The option says \"share a common descendant,\" which might imply someone else, but technically, Julie is a descendant of both, but since Sara is ancestor, Julie is the common descendant. But option 1 is more direct.\n\n3. Sara is Julie's descendant. This is false because we have Sara as ancestor.\n\n4. Sara and Julie share a common ancestor. This might be true, but since Sara is an ancestor, the common ancestor would be Sara herself or someone else, but typically, if Sara is an ancestor, they share Sara as an ancestor, but again, option 1 is precise.\n\nOption 4 says \"share a common ancestor,\" which could be true if there is someone above Sara, but from the lineage, Sara is at the top, so for Julie, Sara is an ancestor, so they share Sara as an ancestor.
