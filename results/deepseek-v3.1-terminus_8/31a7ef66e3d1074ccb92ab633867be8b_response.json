So, Timothy → Dennis.\n\nFrom statement 5: Dennis is Elizabeth's ancestor. So, Dennis → Elizabeth. Therefore, since Timothy → Dennis and Dennis → Elizabeth, that means Timothy → Elizabeth. So Timothy is an ancestor of Elizabeth.\n\nFrom statement 1: Timothy is Martha's descendant. So, Martha → Timothy.\n\nSince Martha → Timothy and Timothy → Elizabeth, then Martha → Elizabeth.
