We have a set of statements about lineage relationships (ancestor/descendant). The statements are in the form \"X is Y's descendant\" meaning X is a descendant of Y (so Y is an ancestor of X). Similarly, \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X is an ancestor of Y (Y is a descendant of X). The statements provide a directed graph of relationships: each statement gives an edge either from ancestor to descendant or descendant to ancestor.\n\nGoal: Determine the relationship between Donna and Eugene (specifically, is Donna a descendant of Eugene, ancestor of Eugene, share a common ancestor, share a common descendant, or none of the above).

We have a chain for Donna up to many ancestors. We have a chain for Eugene up to many ancestors. We need to see if they intersect (share a common ancestor) or if one is ancestor of the other.\n\nWe have:\n\nDonna chain: Donna is descendant of Alexis. So Alexis is ancestor of Donna. And we have chain: Alexis -> (parents? Possibly other ancestors). Let's compile all known ancestors for Donna.\n\nGiven statements:\n\n- Donna is Alexis's descendant.\n- Sara is Alexis's ancestor.\n- Natalie is Sara's ancestor.\n- Ethan is Natalie's ancestor.\n- Ethan is Danielle's descendant (i.e., Ethan descendant of Danielle).

So Eric ancestor of Russell.\n- Rachel is Russell's descendant. So Russell ancestor of Rachel.\n- Rachel is Jack's ancestor. So Rachel ancestor of Jack.\n- Jeffrey is Jack's descendant. So Jack ancestor of Jeffrey.\n- Jeffrey is Evelyn's ancestor. So Jack ancestor of Jeffrey; also Jeffrey ancestor of Evelyn? Wait: \"Jeffrey is Evelyn's ancestor.\" So Jeffrey ancestor of Evelyn. So we have both: Jack -> Jeffrey -> Evelyn. So Jeffrey is ancestor of Evelyn.\n- Teresa is Evelyn's descendant. So Evelyn ancestor of Teresa.\n- Lawrence is Teresa's descendant. So Teresa ancestor of Lawrence.\n- Lawrence is Michelle's ancestor. So Lawrence ancestor of Michelle.\n- Michelle is Joshua's ancestor.

So Carolyn ancestor of Donald.\n- Donald is Bradley's ancestor. So Donald ancestor of Bradley.\n- Bradley is Eugene's ancestor. So Bradley ancestor of Eugene.\n\nThus we have a huge chain linking all individuals.\n\nNow we need to see if Donna and Eugene are related via this chain.\n\nDonna chain ends at many ancestors, culminating in perhaps some root. Eugene chain ends at many ancestors, culminating in some root.\n\nWe need to see if they share a common ancestor or if one is ancestor of the other.\n\nGiven the chain includes many individuals, it's likely that they share a common ancestor somewhere up the chain. But we need to verify.\n\nFirst, we need to find the ancestors of Donna: we have a chain from Donna up to the \"top\" (maybe some individuals not linked to each other). Let's list all ancestors of Donna in order (descendant to ancestor direction). Starting from Donna, we have:\n\nDonna -> (ancestors) Alexis -> Sara -> Natalie -> Ethan -> Danielle -> Lori -> Diane -> Jerry -> Shirley -> Albert -> Janice -> Abigail -> Raymond -> Bruce -> Katherine -> John -> Diana -> Julia -> Andrew -> Michael -> Barbara -> Ronald -> Brenda -> Jason -> Margaret -> Wayne -> Zachary -> Harold -> Christian -> Kayla -> Thomas -> Richard -> Kelly -> George -> Mark -> Julie -> Henry -> Joyce -> Gary -> Jacob -> Brian -> Victoria -> Eric -> Russell -> Rachel -> Jack -> Jeffrey -> Evelyn -> Teresa -> Lawrence -> Michelle -> Joshua -> Kimberly -> Gerald -> Karen -> Joe -> Keith -> Samuel -> Paul -> Carolyn -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene -> ??? Possibly further ancestors beyond Eugene? Not given.\n\nThus Donna and Eugene are in the same chain? Let's examine: Does the chain we listed include Eugene? Yes, at the end, after Bradley, we have Eugene. So Donna's ancestors include Eugene? Wait, we need to verify: The chain we listed is from Donna up through many individuals to Eugene. But is Eugene indeed an ancestor of Donna? Let's see: We have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley is ancestor of Eugene. That means Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So Eugene is not ancestor of Bradley, but descendant. So the chain we listed from Donna to Eugene is from Donna to Eugene via many intermediate individuals, but the direction is: Donna -> ... -> Bradley -> Eugene? Actually we have \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Donald is ancestor of Bradley. So Donald is above Bradley. And \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley is above Eugene. So the chain is: ... -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene. So Eugene is a descendant of Bradley, which is descendant of Donald. So Eugene is below Bradley.\n\nThus Donna's chain includes Bradley and then Eugene. So indeed, Eugene is an ancestor of Donna? Wait, we need to be careful: The direction: \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" So Donna is descendant of Alexis. So Alexis is an ancestor of Donna. So the chain from Donna up to root goes through Alexis, then Sara, etc. The chain we listed goes upward: Donna -> Alexis -> Sara -> ... -> Eugene (since we listed many individuals). But we need to verify if Eugene appears in that chain. In the chain we listed, we have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley is above Eugene, not below. So if we go from Donna up to Eugene, we must go from Donna to Bradley (since Donna is descendant of Bradley) and then to Eugene (descendant of Bradley). But if we go upward from Donna, we go to ancestors, not to descendants. So if we go upward, we should not encounter Eugene, because Eugene is a descendant of Bradley, which is an ancestor of Donna. So Eugene is below Bradley, which is above Donna? Wait, let's think: We need to map the relationships correctly.\n\nWe need to decide the direction of edges. Usually, \"X is Y's descendant\" means X is younger (descendant) and Y is older (ancestor). So the relationship is Y -> X (Y is ancestor, X is descendant). So the edge direction from ancestor to descendant is Y -> X. In graph terms, we have directed edges from ancestor to descendant.\n\nThus \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" means edge Alexis -> Donna.\n\n\"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" means edge Bradley -> Eugene.\n\nThus the chain from Donna up to ancestors goes in reverse direction: we can go from Donna to Alexis (since Alexis -> Donna). Actually, from Donna we can go backwards (i.e., following edges from descendant to ancestor) to its ancestors by reversing direction: Donna's ancestors are those from which there is a path to Donna. So we need to consider the graph directed from ancestor to descendant. So from Donna, we can go upstream (reverse edges) to Alexis, then from Alexis upstream to Sara, etc. But we need to check if there is a path from some ancestor to Donna that goes through all those individuals. Actually, we need to consider the transitive closure.\n\nNow we have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So edge Bradley -> Eugene. So Bradley is ancestor of Eugene. So Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So if we go upstream from Eugene (reverse edges), we go to Bradley, then to Donald, etc. So Eugene's ancestors are Bradley, Donald, etc. So we need to see if there is any overlap between Donna's ancestors and Eugene's ancestors, or if one is ancestor of the other.\n\nThe chain we listed earlier seems to be a path from Donna up to Eugene (i.e., from Donna to some ancestor chain that includes Eugene as a descendant). But that path includes Eugene as a descendant of some earlier ancestor. Let's examine the path we wrote:\n\nDonna -> Alexis -> Sara -> Natalie -> Ethan -> Danielle -> Lori -> Diane -> Jerry -> Shirley -> Albert -> Janice -> Abigail -> Raymond -> Bruce -> Katherine -> John -> Diana -> Julia -> Andrew -> Michael -> Barbara -> Ronald -> Brenda -> Jason -> Margaret -> Wayne -> Zachary -> Harold -> Christian -> Kayla -> Thomas -> Richard -> Kelly -> George -> Mark -> Julie -> Henry -> Joyce -> Gary -> Jacob -> Brian -> Victoria -> Eric -> Russell -> Rachel -> Jack -> Jeffrey -> Evelyn -> Teresa -> Lawrence -> Michelle -> Joshua -> Kimberly -> Gerald -> Karen -> Joe -> Keith -> Samuel -> Paul -> Carolyn -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene\n\nThis is a path where each step is \"X is Y's descendant\" (i.e., Y is ancestor of X). Actually, the direction is: Y -> X. So if we go from Donna to Alexis, that is \"Alexis is ancestor of Donna\". So \"Donna is Alexis's descendant\" is correct. Then from Alexis to Sara: \"Sara is Alexis's ancestor\". So that is \"Sara is ancestor of Alexis\", which means \"Alexis is descendant of Sara\". So from Alexis to Sara we have \"Alexis is descendant of Sara\". So that is consistent: \"Alexis is descendant of Sara\". So the path we listed is a chain of ancestor-descendant relationships where each step is either \"X is Y's descendant\" or \"Y is X's ancestor\". So each step is a direct relationship given in the statements.\n\nThus the chain we listed is indeed a valid chain of relationships connecting Donna to Eugene via a sequence of direct statements. However, we need to verify that each step in the chain is supported by a given statement. Let's check each step:\n\n- Donna -> Alexis: \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Alexis -> Sara: \"Sara is Alexis's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Sara -> Natalie: \"Natalie is Sara's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Natalie -> Ethan: \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Ethan -> Danielle: \"Ethan is Danielle's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Danielle -> Lori: \"Danielle is Lori's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Lori -> Diane: \"Diane is Lori's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Diane -> Jerry: \"Jerry is Diane's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Jerry -> Shirley: \"Shirley is Jerry's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Shirley -> Albert: \"Shirley is Albert's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Albert -> Janice: \"Janice is Albert's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Janice -> Abigail: \"Janice is Abigail's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Abigail -> Raymond: \"Raymond is Abigail's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Raymond -> Bruce: \"Bruce is Raymond's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Bruce -> Katherine: \"Bruce is Katherine's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Katherine -> John: \"Katherine is John's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- John -> Diana: \"Diana is John's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Diana -> Julia: \"Julia is Diana's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Julia -> Andrew: \"Julia is Andrew's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Andrew -> Michael: \"Michael is Andrew's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Michael -> Barbara: \"Michael is Barbara's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Barbara -> Ronald: \"Ronald is Barbara's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Ronald -> Brenda: \"Brenda is Ronald's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Brenda -> Jason: \"Brenda is Jason's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Jason -> Margaret: \"Jason is Margaret's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Margaret -> Wayne: \"Margaret is Wayne's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Wayne -> Zachary: \"Zachary is Wayne's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Zachary -> Harold: \"Zachary is Harold's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Harold -> Christian: \"Harold is Christian's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Christian -> Kayla: \"Christian is Kayla's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Kayla -> Thomas: \"Kayla is Thomas's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Thomas -> Richard: \"Thomas is Richard's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Richard -> Kelly: \"Kelly is Richard's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Kelly -> George: \"Kelly is George's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- George -> Mark: \"George is Mark's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Mark -> Julie: \"Julie is Mark's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Julie -> Henry: \"Julie is Henry's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Henry -> Joyce: \"Joyce is Henry's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Joyce -> Gary: \"Gary is Joyce's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Gary -> Jacob: \"Gary is Jacob's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Jacob -> Brian: \"Jacob is Brian's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Brian -> Victoria: \"Brian is Victoria's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Victoria -> Eric: \"Eric is Victoria's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Eric -> Russell: \"Russell is Eric's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Russell -> Rachel: \"Rachel is Russell's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Rachel -> Jack: \"Rachel is Jack's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Jack -> Jeffrey: \"Jeffrey is Jack's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Jeffrey -> Evelyn: \"Jeffrey is Evelyn's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Evelyn -> Teresa: \"Teresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Teresa -> Lawrence: \"Lawrence is Teresa's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Lawrence -> Michelle: \"Lawrence is Michelle's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Michelle -> Joshua: \"Michelle is Joshua's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Joshua -> Kimberly: \"Joshua is Kimberly's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Kimberly -> Gerald: \"Kimberly is Gerald's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Gerald -> Karen: \"Gerald is Karen's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Karen -> Joe: \"Joe is Karen's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Joe -> Keith: \"Keith is Joe's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Keith -> Samuel: \"Keith is Samuel's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Samuel -> Paul: \"Samuel is Paul's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Paul -> Carolyn: \"Paul is Carolyn's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Carolyn -> Donald: \"Donald is Carolyn's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Donald -> Bradley: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Bradley -> Eugene: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\nThus we have a chain connecting Donna to Eugene via these relationships. The chain goes from Donna up through ancestors and then down to Eugene? Actually, the chain alternates direction: at each step, the relationship is either \"X is Y's descendant\" or \"Y is X's ancestor\". In the chain, we have direction changes. For example, from Donna to Alexis: Donna is descendant of Alexis (so Alexis is ancestor). Then Alexis to Sara: Sara is ancestor of Alexis (so Sara is higher). So the chain goes upward (to older generations) as we go from Donna to Sara to Natalie to Ethan etc. However, at some points, the direction flips: e.g., from Ethan to Danielle: Ethan is descendant of Danielle, so we go downwards (to younger generation). So the chain is not monotonic in age; it's just a path through the graph. The graph may have cycles? Possibly there are cycles (like some persons may be both ancestors and descendants of each other indirectly). But we need to find the relationship between Donna and Eugene: Are they directly connected via ancestry? The path we found suggests that there is a path from Donna to Eugene via these relationships. However, the question is about lineage relationship: \"Donna is Eugene's descendant\" or \"Donna is Eugene's ancestor\" or they share a common ancestor, or share a common descendant, or none of the above.\n\nGiven that we have a path from Donna to Eugene, but does that path reflect a direct ancestor-descendant relationship? Let's examine the path direction: Starting from Donna, we go to Alexis (Donna descendant of Alexis). Then to Sara (Alexis descendant of Sara). So at this point, we have moved upward to Sara (older). Then to Natalie (Sara descendant of Natalie). Then to Ethan (Natalie descendant of Ethan). Actually, \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor\" means Ethan is ancestor of Natalie, so Natalie is descendant of Ethan. So we moved downward to Ethan (younger). Then to Danielle (Ethan descendant of Danielle). So we moved upward to Danielle? Wait, \"Ethan is Danielle's descendant\" means Ethan is descendant of Danielle, so Danielle is ancestor of Ethan. So we moved upward to Danielle (older). Then to Lori (Danielle descendant of Lori) meaning Danielle is descendant of Lori, so we moved upward to Lori (older). Then to Diane (Lori descendant of Diane) means Diane is ancestor of Lori, so we moved upward to Diane (older). Then to Jerry (Diane descendant of Jerry) meaning Jerry is ancestor of Diane, so we moved upward to Jerry (older). Then to Shirley (Jerry descendant of Shirley) meaning Shirley is ancestor of Jerry, so we moved upward to Shirley (older). Then to Albert (Shirley descendant of Albert) meaning Albert is ancestor of Shirley, so we moved upward to Albert (older).

So we see that the chain goes upward (older) each step, except some steps where we go downward (younger) (like from Ethan to Danielle, from Katherine to John? Actually, we need to check each step: The pattern is consistent: each step goes upward to the ancestor of the previous person. But sometimes the direction flips? Let's examine each step more carefully:\n\n- Start: Donna (descendant of Alexis). So Alexis is ancestor of Donna. So moving from Donna to Alexis is moving up.\n\n- Alexis is descendant of Sara. So moving from Alexis to Sara is moving up.\n\n- Sara is descendant of Natalie. So moving from Sara to Natalie is moving up.\n\n- Natalie is ancestor of Ethan? Actually \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor.\" So Ethan is ancestor of Natalie. So moving from Natalie to Ethan is moving down (since Natalie is descendant of Ethan). Wait, \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor\" means Ethan is older than Natalie. So Natalie is descendant of Ethan. So moving from Natalie to Ethan goes up to an older generation. So it's still moving up (to ancestor). Actually, earlier we said \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor\" means Ethan is ancestor of Natalie, so Natalie is descendant of Ethan. So moving from Natalie to Ethan goes up (to ancestor). So consistent.\n\n- Ethan is descendant of Danielle. So moving from Ethan to Danielle is moving up (to ancestor). Wait, \"Ethan is Danielle's descendant\" means Ethan is younger, Danielle is older. So moving from Ethan to Danielle goes up.\n\n- Danielle is descendant of Lori. So moving from Danielle to Lori goes up.\n\n- Lori is descendant of Diane. So moving from Lori to Diane goes up.\n\n- Diane is descendant of Jerry. So moving from Diane to Jerry goes up.\n\n- Jerry is descendant of Shirley. So moving from Jerry to Shirley goes up.\n\n- Shirley is descendant of Albert.

So moving from Katherine to John goes up.\n\n- John is descendant of Diana. So moving from John to Diana goes up.\n\n- Diana is descendant of Julia. So moving from Diana to Julia goes up.\n\n- Julia is descendant of Andrew. So moving from Julia to Andrew goes up.\n\n- Andrew is descendant of Michael. So moving from Andrew to Michael goes up.\n\n- Michael is descendant of Barbara. So moving from Michael to Barbara goes up.\n\n- Barbara is descendant of Ronald. So moving from Barbara to Ronald goes up.\n\n- Ronald is descendant of Brenda. So moving from Ronald to Brenda goes up.\n\n- Brenda is descendant of Jason. So moving from Brenda to Jason goes up.\n\n- Jason is descendant of Margaret. So moving from Jason to Margaret goes up.\n\n- Margaret is descendant of Wayne. So moving from Margaret to Wayne goes up.\n\n- Wayne is descendant of Zachary. So moving from Wayne to Zachary goes up.\n\n- Zachary is descendant of Harold. So moving from Zachary to Harold goes up.\n\n- Harold is descendant of Christian. So moving from Harold to Christian goes up.\n\n- Christian is descendant of Kayla. So moving from Christian to Kayla goes up.\n\n- Kayla is descendant of Thomas. So moving from Kayla to Thomas goes up.\n\n- Thomas is descendant of Richard. So moving from Thomas to Richard goes up.\n\n- Richard is descendant of Kelly. So moving from Richard to Kelly goes up.\n\n- Kelly is descendant of George. So moving from Kelly to George goes up.\n\n- George is descendant of Mark. So moving from George to Mark goes up.\n\n- Mark is descendant of Julie. So moving from Mark to Julie goes up.\n\n- Julie is descendant of Henry. So moving from Julie to Henry goes up.\n\n- Henry is descendant of Joyce. So moving from Henry to Joyce goes up.\n\n- Joyce is descendant of Gary. So moving from Joyce to Gary goes up.\n\n- Gary is descendant of Jacob. So moving from Gary to Jacob goes up.\n\n- Jacob is descendant of Brian. So moving from Jacob to Brian goes up.\n\n- Brian is descendant of Victoria. So moving from Brian to Victoria goes up.\n\n- Victoria is descendant of Eric. So moving from Victoria to Eric goes up.\n\n- Eric is descendant of Russell. So moving from Eric to Russell goes up.\n\n- Russell is descendant of Rachel. So moving from Russell to Rachel goes up.\n\n- Rachel is descendant of Jack. So moving from Rachel to Jack goes up.\n\n- Jack is descendant of Jeffrey. So moving from Jack to Jeffrey goes up.\n\n- Jeffrey is descendant of Evelyn. So moving from Jeffrey to Evelyn goes up.\n\n- Evelyn is descendant of Teresa. So moving from Evelyn to Teresa goes up.\n\n- Teresa is descendant of Lawrence. So moving from Teresa to Lawrence goes up.\n\n- Lawrence is descendant of Michelle. So moving from Lawrence to Michelle goes up.\n\n- Michelle is descendant of Joshua. So moving from Michelle to Joshua goes up.\n\n- Joshua is descendant of Kimberly. So moving from Joshua to Kimberly goes up.\n\n- Kimberly is descendant of Gerald. So moving from Kimberly to Gerald goes up.\n\n- Gerald is descendant of Karen. So moving from Gerald to Karen goes up.\n\n- Karen is descendant of Joe. So moving from Karen to Joe goes up.\n\n- Joe is descendant of Keith. So moving from Joe to Keith goes up.\n\n- Keith is descendant of Samuel. So moving from Keith to Samuel goes up.\n\n- Samuel is descendant of Paul. So moving from Samuel to Paul goes up.\n\n- Paul is descendant of Carolyn. So moving from Paul to Carolyn goes up.\n\n- Carolyn is descendant of Donald. So moving from Carolyn to Donald goes up.\n\n- Donald is descendant of Bradley. So moving from Donald to Bradley goes up.\n\n- Bradley is descendant of Eugene. So moving from Bradley to Eugene goes up.\n\nThus the entire chain is a monotonic upward path from Donna to Eugene, each step moving to an ancestor. So indeed, Eugene is an ancestor of Donna? Wait, we need to be careful: In the chain, we move from Donna to Alexis (ancestor), then to Sara (ancestor), etc., eventually to Eugene (ancestor). So each step moves upward to older individuals. So the final node Eugene is older than the previous node (Bradley). So Eugene is older than Bradley, which is older than Donald, etc., all the way up to Donna. So Eugene is an ancestor of Donna. But we need to verify the direction: The statements are \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" That means Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, i.e., Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So if we go from Bradley to Eugene, we go downwards (to younger). However, in our chain we went from Bradley to Eugene as moving upward (from descendant to ancestor). That seems contradictory. Let's examine: The statement \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" means Bradley is an ancestor of Eugene. In terms of directed edges from ancestor to descendant, we have edge Bradley -> Eugene. So if we move from Bradley to Eugene, we are moving downwards (to descendant). But in our chain we moved from Bradley to Eugene as part of moving upward from Donna to Eugene. However, in the chain we wrote earlier, we said \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So moving from Bradley to Eugene goes downwards. But we are moving from Donna up to Eugene via intermediate steps. Let's see the direction: Starting from Donna, we go up to Alexis, then to Sara, etc., eventually to Bradley, then to Eugene. Actually, we need to check the direction of each step in the chain relative to the edge direction.\n\nIf we have edge X -> Y (X ancestor of Y). Then moving from Y to X is moving upwards (to ancestor). So if we have edge Bradley -> Eugene, then moving from Eugene to Bradley is moving up to ancestor. But we are moving from Bradley to Eugene in the chain (i.e., we go from Bradley to Eugene). That would be moving downwards (to descendant). However, earlier we said the chain is monotonic upward from Donna to Eugene. That seems contradictory. Let's examine the chain again: The chain we wrote: Donna -> Alexis -> Sara -> Natalie -> Ethan -> Danielle -> Lori -> Diane -> Jerry -> Shirley -> Albert -> Janice -> Abigail -> Raymond -> Bruce -> Katherine -> John -> Diana -> Julia -> Andrew -> Michael -> Barbara -> Ronald -> Brenda -> Jason -> Margaret -> Wayne -> Zachary -> Harold -> Christian -> Kayla -> Thomas -> Richard -> Kelly -> George -> Mark -> Julie -> Henry -> Joyce -> Gary -> Jacob -> Brian -> Victoria -> Eric -> Russell -> Rachel -> Jack -> Jeffrey -> Evelyn -> Teresa -> Lawrence -> Michelle -> Joshua -> Kimberly -> Gerald -> Karen -> Joe -> Keith -> Samuel -> Paul -> Carolyn -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene.\n\nWe need to check each step's direction relative to the edge direction. For each step we need to verify that there is a direct relationship (either X is Y's descendant or Y is X's ancestor). The chain alternates between \"X is Y's descendant\" and \"Y is X's ancestor\" statements. The direction of the relationship (who is ancestor of who) changes each step.\n\nSpecifically, the statements are of two types:\n\n- \"X is Y's descendant.\" => X descendant of Y => Y ancestor of X => edge Y -> X.\n\n- \"X is Y's ancestor.\" => X ancestor of Y => edge X -> Y.\n\nThus the chain we wrote includes both types.\n\nNow, for each step, we need to check that the statement matches the direction of the edge relative to the chain order. Let's re-evaluate each step:\n\nStep 1: Donna -> Alexis: \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" This matches the pattern: X (Donna) is Y's descendant => Y (Alexis) is ancestor of X (Donna). So the edge is Alexis -> Donna. In the chain order, we go from Donna (descendant) to Alexis (ancestor). So we go from descendant to ancestor (upwards). That's consistent.\n\nStep 2: Alexis -> Sara: \"Sara is Alexis's ancestor.\" This matches: X (Sara) is Y's ancestor => X (Sara) ancestor of Y (Alexis). Edge: Sara -> Alexis. In the chain order, we go from Alexis (descendant) to Sara (ancestor). So we go from descendant to ancestor (upwards). Good.\n\nStep 3: Sara -> Natalie: \"Natalie is Sara's ancestor.\" => Natalie ancestor of Sara => edge Natalie -> Sara. In chain order, we go from Sara (descendant) to Natalie (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 4: Natalie -> Ethan: \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor.\" => Ethan ancestor of Natalie => edge Ethan -> Natalie. Chain: from Natalie (descendant) to Ethan (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 5: Ethan -> Danielle: \"Ethan is Danielle's descendant.\" => X (Ethan) is Y's descendant => Y (Danielle) is ancestor of X (Ethan). So edge Danielle -> Ethan. Chain: from Ethan (descendant) to Danielle (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 6: Danielle -> Lori: \"Danielle is Lori's descendant.\" => Danielle descendant of Lori => edge Lori -> Danielle.

Chain: from Donald (descendant) to Bradley (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 63: Bradley -> Eugene: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" => Bradley ancestor of Eugene => edge Bradley -> Eugene. Chain: from Bradley (descendant) to Eugene (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nThus indeed, each step in the chain moves upward (to an ancestor). So the chain goes from Donna up to Eugene, meaning Eugene is an ancestor of Donna (since we moved upward to Eugene). However, we need to verify that \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor\" means Bradley is older than Eugene, so moving from Bradley to Eugene is moving downwards (to descendant). But we moved from Bradley to Eugene as upward step, which seems contradictory. Let's examine the meaning: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" This statement says Bradley is ancestor of Eugene. In terms of directed edge, we have Bradley -> Eugene (ancestor to descendant). So moving from Bradley to Eugene moves downwards (to younger). However, in our chain, we moved from Donna to Bradley (upwards). Then from Bradley to Eugene (downwards). But earlier we said the chain moves upward each step, but that may be inaccurate for the final step. Let's check the direction of the final step relative to the chain order.\n\nWe have chain: ... -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene.\n\nWe have statements:\n\n- Donald is Bradley's ancestor. (Donald ancestor of Bradley). So edge Donald -> Bradley. So moving from Donald to Bradley is moving downwards (to descendant). But earlier we said moving from Donald (descendant) to Bradley (ancestor) is upward. Actually, we need to see the pattern: The chain we wrote is Donna -> ... -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene. In our chain, we moved from Donna to Alexis (upward), then to Sara (upward), etc., all the way to Donald (which we consider descendant of Bradley). But the direction for each step is based on the statement type. Let's verify the direction of the step from Donald to Bradley.\n\nStatement: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" This says Donald is ancestor of Bradley. So Donald is older than Bradley. So moving from Donald to Bradley is moving downwards (to younger). However, in the chain we wrote, we treat Donald as descendant of Bradley? Let's re-evaluate.\n\nWe need to understand the chain direction precisely. The chain we wrote is a sequence of individuals where each adjacent pair is related by a direct statement. The direction of the relationship can be either \"X is Y's descendant\" or \"Y is X's ancestor\". In each case, the relationship direction is fixed: if we have \"X is Y's descendant\", then Y is ancestor of X. If we have \"Y is X's ancestor\", then Y is ancestor of X. So in both cases, the ancestor is the one that appears first in the statement after \"X is Y's descendant\" (the \"Y\") and after \"Y is X's ancestor\" (the \"Y\").\n\nThus for each step we can identify the ancestor (the older person) and descendant (the younger person). The chain we wrote goes from a descendant to an ancestor (i.e., from younger to older). So each step moves upward (to older). But we need to check if each step indeed moves upward. Let's verify each step's orientation:\n\n- Step 1: \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" The ancestor is Alexis, descendant is Donna. So moving from Donna to Alexis moves upward.\n\n- Step 2: \"Sara is Alexis's ancestor.\" Ancestor is Sara, descendant is Alexis. So moving from Alexis to Sara moves upward.\n\n- Step 3: \"Natalie is Sara's ancestor.\" Ancestor Natalie, descendant Sara. So moving from Sara to Natalie upward.\n\n- Step 4: \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor.\" Ancestor Ethan, descendant Natalie. So moving from Natalie to Ethan upward.\n\n- Step 5: \"Ethan is Danielle's descendant.\" Ancestor Danielle, descendant Ethan. So moving from Ethan to Danielle upward.\n\n- Step 6: \"Danielle is Lori's descendant.\" Ancestor Lori, descendant Danielle. So moving from Danielle to Lori upward.\n\n- Step 7: \"Diane is Lori's ancestor.\" Ancestor Diane, descendant Lori. So moving from Lori to Diane upward.\n\n- Step 8: \"Jerry is Diane's ancestor.\" Ancestor Jerry, descendant Diane. So moving from Diane to Jerry upward.\n\n- Step 9: \"Shirley is Jerry's ancestor.\" Ancestor Shirley, descendant Jerry. So moving from Jerry to Shirley upward.\n\n- Step 10: \"Shirley is Albert's descendant.\" Ancestor Albert, descendant Shirley. So moving from Shirley to Albert upward.\n\n- Step 11: \"Janice is Albert's ancestor.\" Ancestor Janice, descendant Albert. So moving from Albert to Janice upward.\n\n- Step 12: \"Janice is Abigail's descendant.\" Ancestor Abigail, descendant Janice. So moving from Janice to Abigail upward.\n\n- Step 13: \"Raymond is Abigail's ancestor.\" Ancestor Raymond, descendant Abigail.

So moving from Donald to Bradley upward.\n\n- Step 63: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" Ancestor Bradley, descendant Eugene. So moving from Bradley to Eugene upward.\n\nThus indeed, each step moves upward (to older). So the chain is monotonic upward. That means Eugene is older (ancestor) than Bradley, which is older than Donald, etc., all the way to Donna. So Eugene is an ancestor of Donna.\n\nThus the relationship between Donna and Eugene is: Donna is a descendant of Eugene (i.e., Eugene is an ancestor of Donna). But we need to confirm that Eugene is indeed an ancestor of Donna (i.e., there is a path from Eugene to Donna following ancestor-to-descendant edges). Let's check the path from Eugene downwards (i.e., from ancestor to descendant) to Donna. Starting from Eugene, we have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" Wait, that says Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, not descendant. So Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So moving from Eugene to Bradley is moving downwards (to older?). Actually, moving from Eugene to Bradley moves to an ancestor (older). So if we want to go from Eugene to Donna following ancestor-to-descendant edges, we need to go from Eugene up to its ancestors (Bradley, Donald, etc.) and then eventually to Donna? Wait, we need to consider the direction of the edges.\n\nWe have edges from ancestor to descendant. For each statement \"X is Y's ancestor\", we have edge X -> Y. For each statement \"X is Y's descendant\", we have edge Y -> X. So the edges are oriented from ancestor to descendant.\n\nThus the graph is directed from older to younger. The chain we wrote goes from Donna (descendant) up to Eugene (ancestor). That is moving opposite direction of edges (i.e., from descendant to ancestor). So the chain is a path in the reverse direction of edges. So the path from Eugene to Donna is the reverse of that chain, which follows edges in the forward direction (ancestor to descendant). So we need to reverse the chain to get a path from Eugene to Donna (ancestor to descendant). Let's reverse the chain:\n\nEugene -> Bradley -> Donald -> Carolyn -> Paul -> Samuel -> Keith -> Joe -> Karen -> Gerald -> Kimberly -> Joshua -> Michelle -> Lawrence -> Teresa -> Evelyn -> Jeffrey -> Jack -> Rachel -> Russell -> Eric -> Victoria -> Brian -> Jacob -> Gary -> Joyce -> Henry -> Julie -> Mark -> George -> Kelly -> Richard -> Thomas -> Kayla -> Christian -> Harold -> Zachary -> Wayne -> Margaret -> Jason -> Brenda -> Ronald -> Barbara -> Michael -> Andrew -> Julia -> Diana -> John -> Katherine -> Bruce -> Raymond -> Abigail -> Janice -> Albert -> Shirley -> Jerry -> Diane -> Lori -> Danielle -> Ethan -> Natalie -> Sara -> Alexis -> Donna.\n\nNow we need to verify each reversed step corresponds to an edge from ancestor to descendant (i.e., a forward direction in the graph). Let's verify each reversed step:\n\n- Eugene -> Bradley: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" Means Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, so edge Bradley -> Eugene. So moving from Eugene to Bradley is moving opposite direction (from descendant to ancestor). Actually, we need to check: If we reverse the chain, we go from Eugene to Bradley. In the graph, edge is Bradley -> Eugene (ancestor to descendant). So moving from Eugene to Bradley is moving opposite direction (descendant to ancestor). But we want to go from ancestor to descendant. So maybe we need to reverse the chain differently.\n\nHold on. Let's be systematic. The chain we wrote is a sequence of relationships such that each adjacent pair is directly related by a statement. But the direction of the relationship (who is ancestor of who) alternates. The chain we wrote is a path where each step is a direct relationship (i.e., either \"X is Y's descendant\" or \"Y is X's ancestor\"). The direction of the relationship is always from the older to the younger (ancestor to descendant). However, the chain we wrote goes from younger to older each step. So the chain is reversed relative to the directed edges. So each step is a reverse edge.\n\nThus the chain is a path in the reverse direction of the directed graph. So the reverse of the chain is a path in the forward direction (ancestor to descendant). So we can invert the chain to get a path from Eugene (the oldest) to Donna (the youngest). However, we need to check if the reversed chain indeed matches the directed edges.\n\nLet's reverse the chain and see if each reversed step corresponds to a direct statement that says the first person is an ancestor of the second (i.e., edge from first to second). The reversed chain would be:\n\nEugene <- Bradley <- Donald <- Carolyn <- Paul <- Samuel <- Keith <- Joe <- Karen <- Gerald <- Kimberly <- Joshua <- Michelle <- Lawrence <- Teresa <- Evelyn <- Jeffrey <- Jack <- Rachel <- Russell <- Eric <- Victoria <- Brian <- Jacob <- Gary <- Joyce <- Henry <- Julie <- Mark <- George <- Kelly <- Richard <- Thomas <- Kayla <- Christian <- Harold <- Zachary <- Wayne <- Margaret <- Jason <- Brenda <- Ronald <- Barbara <- Michael <- Andrew <- Julia <- Diana <- John <- Katherine <- Bruce <- Raymond <- Abigail <- Janice <- Albert <- Shirley <- Jerry <- Diane <- Lori <- Danielle <- Ethan <- Natalie <- Sara <- Alexis <- Donna.\n\nBut we need to check if each of these reversed steps is a direct statement that matches the pattern \"X is Y's ancestor\". For example, \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" This is \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So in the reversed chain, we have Eugene (descendant) to Bradley (ancestor). That is not a direct statement of \"X is Y's ancestor\" with X being the first (Eugene) and Y being the second (Bradley). The direct statement is \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So the direction is from Bradley (ancestor) to Eugene (descendant). In the reversed chain, we have Eugene -> Bradley. So that's the opposite direction. So the reversed chain does not correspond to a direct statement in the forward direction.\n\nThus the chain we wrote is not a directed path from ancestor to descendant, but a chain of alternating statements that go from descendant to ancestor each step. That means the chain is a path in the undirected sense, but not necessarily a directed path.\n\nThus we need to determine the relationship between Donna and Eugene based on the given statements, not necessarily that there is a directed path from one to the other. The possible relationships are:\n\n- Donna is Eugene's descendant (i.e., there exists a directed path from Eugene to Donna following ancestor-to-descendant edges). This would require that there is a chain where each step is of the form \"X is Y's ancestor\" (i.e., X ancestor of Y) such that we can go from Eugene to Donna. Or equivalently, there is a chain of statements that connect Eugene to Donna where each statement is of the form \"X is Y's ancestor\" (or \"Y is X's descendant\").\n\n- Donna is Eugene's ancestor (i.e., there is a directed path from Donna to Eugene following ancestor-to-descendant edges). This would require statements that say Donna is ancestor of Eugene, or Donna is ancestor of some intermediate, etc.\n\n- They share a common ancestor (i.e., there exists some person X such that X is an ancestor of both Donna and Eugene). This is a weaker condition: there exists a node that is an ancestor of both.\n\n- They share a common descendant (i.e., there exists a node that is a descendant of both Donna and Eugene). This is also possible.\n\n- None of the above (i.e., they are unrelated in all these senses).\n\nWe need to determine which is correct.\n\nGiven the huge chain connecting them, it seems they share a common ancestor (maybe many). But we need to verify if they share a common ancestor. The chain we found seems to be a path connecting Donna and Eugene via many intermediate relationships. That suggests they are in the same lineage tree, thus they share a common ancestor (some root). However, the chain includes both ancestors and descendants, but the fact that there is a path connecting them suggests they are in the same connected component of the graph. However, we need to be careful: The graph is directed (ancestor->descendant). If we treat it as an undirected graph, there is a path connecting Donna and Eugene. But for \"share a common ancestor\" we need a node that is an ancestor of both Donna and Eugene (i.e., there is a directed path from that node to Donna and also from that node to Eugene). Since the graph is directed, a common ancestor would be a node from which there are directed paths to both Donna and Eugene. Does such a node exist? Possibly many.\n\nGiven the chain we found includes many nodes, but many of those nodes are ancestors of both? Let's examine the chain we wrote: Starting from Donna, we go to Alexis (ancestor), then to Sara (ancestor), etc., eventually to Eugene (ancestor). So the chain is a path of ancestors linking Donna to Eugene. That means that all intermediate nodes are ancestors of Donna (since we moved upward). Also, all intermediate nodes are ancestors of Eugene? Actually, moving upward from Donna to Eugene means we are moving to older persons. So the nodes we encounter are ancestors of Donna, and also ancestors of Eugene? Not necessarily. For a node to be an ancestor of Eugene, we need to have a directed path from that node to Eugene (ancestor->descendant). In the chain we have nodes that are ancestors of Donna but not necessarily ancestors of Eugene. However, we need to examine the graph's direction for each node relative to Eugene.\n\nLet's consider the chain: Starting at Donna (descendant of Alexis). So Alexis is ancestor of Donna. Next we have Alexis (descendant of Sara). So Sara is ancestor of Alexis, and thus also ancestor of Donna (by transitivity). So Sara is ancestor of Donna.

Continue: Carolyn is ancestor of Paul, thus also ancestor of Donna. Continue: Donald is ancestor of Carolyn, thus also ancestor of Donna. Continue: Bradley is ancestor of Donald, thus also ancestor of Donna. Continue: Eugene is ancestor of Bradley, thus also ancestor of Donna.\n\nThus indeed, every node in the chain is an ancestor of Donna, and Eugene is the final ancestor. So Eugene is an ancestor of Donna. Therefore, Donna is Eugene's descendant. So answer 1: \"Donna is Eugene's descendant.\"\n\nBut we need to verify that the direction of the final edge (Bradley -> Eugene) is correct. Actually, we need to check \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley is ancestor of Eugene. So moving from Bradley to Eugene is moving downwards (to descendant). So Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So Eugene is a descendant of Bradley. So if Bradley is an ancestor of Donna, then Eugene is also an ancestor of Donna? Wait, if Bradley is ancestor of Donna, then Eugene is descendant of Bradley, so Eugene is younger than Bradley. So Eugene might be a descendant of Bradley, which is an ancestor of Donna. So Eugene could be a descendant of an ancestor of Donna, which does not guarantee Eugene is an ancestor of Donna. In fact, if Eugene is descendant of an ancestor of Donna, then Eugene could be either an ancestor of Donna (if Eugene is also ancestor of Donna) or a descendant of an ancestor but not necessarily an ancestor of Donna. Let's examine the chain more carefully.\n\nThe chain we wrote is a series of relationships where each step moves from a descendant to an ancestor (i.e., we are moving upward). The final step is from Bradley (descendant) to Eugene (ancestor). So Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley? Wait, the statement \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor\" says Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, meaning Bradley is older than Eugene. So moving from Bradley (descendant) to Eugene (ancestor) would be moving upward (from descendant to ancestor). But that contradicts the statement: If Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, then Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So moving from Bradley to Eugene is moving downwards (to descendant). However, in our chain, we treat \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor\" as the step from Bradley to Eugene, moving upward. But the statement says Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, so moving from Bradley to Eugene is moving downwards. So we need to correct our interpretation.\n\nLet's re-express the chain step by step with proper orientation:\n\nWe need to find a chain connecting Donna and Eugene where each adjacent pair is directly related by a statement. The chain can be oriented either way; we just need a path. The chain we wrote is a valid path (undirected). However, the direction of each relationship is not necessarily consistent with moving from Donna to Eugene; it's just a series of statements linking them.\n\nThus we need to check if there is a directed path from Eugene to Donna (i.e., Eugene is ancestor of Donna) or from Donna to Eugene (Donna is ancestor of Eugene). The chain we found is not directed, but we can check if any directed path exists.\n\nGiven the statements, we can try to see if there is a directed path from Eugene to Donna. For that, we need to follow edges from ancestor to descendant. Let's try to trace from Eugene.\n\nWe have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So edge: Bradley -> Eugene (Bradley ancestor of Eugene). So from Eugene, we cannot go to Bradley (since edge is from Bradley to Eugene). So Eugene is descendant of Bradley, not ancestor. So from Eugene, there is no outgoing edge to Bradley (since edge is incoming). So we cannot go from Eugene to Bradley following ancestor-to-descendant direction. So there is no directed path from Eugene to Bradley. So Eugene cannot be ancestor of Donna, because the chain from Eugene would go nowhere. However, maybe there is a different path from Eugene to Donna via some other edges. Let's examine all statements involving Eugene: Only \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Eugene appears only in that statement. So Eugene has no outgoing edges (i.e., no statements where Eugene is ancestor of someone). So Eugene has no children (descendants) in the directed graph. Thus Eugene is a leaf (i.e., no descendant). Therefore Eugene cannot be ancestor of Donna (since that would require a directed path from Eugene to Donna). So answer 1 (Donna is Eugene's descendant) is false because that would require Eugene to be ancestor of Donna (i.e., there is a directed path from Eugene to Donna). Since Eugene has no outgoing edges, it cannot be ancestor of anyone. So answer 1 is not correct.\n\nNow, can Donna be ancestor of Eugene? That would require a directed path from Donna to Eugene (i.e., there is a chain of statements where each step is \"X is Y's ancestor\" (or \"Y is X's descendant\") such that we go from Donna to Eugene. Let's check if there is a directed path from Donna to Eugene. Since we have a chain that connects them (undirected), but the direction of each edge may be such that we can go from Donna to Eugene following the direction of edges (i.e., each step must be an ancestor to descendant direction). Let's see.\n\nWe need to find a path from Donna to Eugene where each step is consistent with the directed edges. Let's examine the chain we wrote in the forward direction (i.e., from Donna to Eugene). At each step, we need to see if the direction of the edge matches the direction of the chain.\n\nWe have the chain of relationships as we wrote: Donna -> Alexis (Donna descendant of Alexis). The edge direction is Alexis -> Donna. So moving from Donna to Alexis is opposite direction of edge. So that step is not allowed if we require directed edges. So we cannot go from Donna to Alexis using a forward edge. But we could go from Alexis to Donna using forward edge. But we need to go from Donna to Eugene, so we need to start at Donna and go to an ancestor (i.e., we need to go backwards). So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, we could go from Donna to some descendant? Does Donna have any outgoing edges? Let's see: Donna appears only in \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" So there is no statement where Donna is ancestor of someone else. So Donna has no outgoing edges either. So Donna cannot be ancestor of anyone else. So Donna cannot be ancestor of Eugene. So answer 2 (Donna is Eugene's ancestor) is false.\n\nThus Donna and Eugene are not directly ancestor/descendant.\n\nNow, do they share a common ancestor? That would require some node X such that X is ancestor of both Donna and Eugene (i.e., there is a directed path from X to Donna and from X to Eugene). Since Eugene has no outgoing edges, the only way X can be ancestor of Eugene is if X is a direct ancestor (i.e., edge from X to Eugene). The only statement involving Eugene is \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So X must be Bradley (or any ancestor of Bradley). So any ancestor of Bradley is also ancestor of Eugene (by transitivity). So any node that is an ancestor of Bradley (i.e., a node that has a directed path to Bradley) is an ancestor of Eugene. So we need to find if there is a node that is an ancestor of both Donna and Eugene. That is, find a node X such that there is a directed path X -> ... -> Donna and X -> ... -> Eugene. Since Eugene's only ancestors are those that have a directed path to Bradley (or to Eugene directly). Let's find ancestors of Eugene:\n\n- Direct ancestor: Bradley (edge Bradley -> Eugene). So Bradley is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\n- Ancestors of Bradley: We need to find all nodes that have a directed path to Bradley. Looking at the statements: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Donald -> Bradley. Also \"Carolyn is Paul's ancestor\"? No, \"Paul is Carolyn's ancestor.\" So Paul -> Carolyn. Also \"Samuel is Paul's ancestor.\" => Samuel -> Paul. \"Keith is Samuel's ancestor.\" => Keith -> Samuel. \"Joe is Karen's descendant.\" => Karen -> Joe. \"Gerald is Karen's ancestor.\" => Gerald -> Karen. \"Kimberly is Gerald's ancestor.\" => Kimberly -> Gerald. \"Joshua is Kimberly's ancestor.\" => Joshua -> Kimberly. \"Michelle is Joshua's ancestor.\" => Michelle -> Joshua. \"Lawrence is Michelle's ancestor.\" => Lawrence -> Michelle. \"Teresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" => Evelyn -> Teresa. \"Evelyn is Jeffrey's ancestor.\" => Jeffrey -> Evelyn. \"Jack is Rachel's descendant.\" => Rachel -> Jack. \"Russell is Eric's descendant.\" => Eric -> Russell. \"Victoria is Brian's ancestor.\" => Brian -> Victoria. \"Jacob is Brian's ancestor.\" => Jacob -> Brian. \"Gary is Jacob's ancestor.\" => Gary -> Jacob. \"Joyce is Henry's descendant.\" => Henry -> Joyce. \"Julie is Henry's ancestor.\" => Julie -> Henry. \"Mark is George's descendant.\" => George -> Mark. \"Kelly is George's ancestor.\" => Kelly -> George. \"Richard is Thomas's ancestor.\" => Thomas -> Richard. \"Kayla is Thomas's ancestor.\" => Kayla -> Thomas. \"Christian is Kayla's ancestor.\" => Christian -> Kayla. \"Harold is Christian's ancestor.\" => Harold -> Christian. \"Zachary is Harold's ancestor.\" => Zachary -> Harold. \"Wayne is Margaret's ancestor.\" => Margaret -> Wayne. \"Jason is Margaret's ancestor.\" => Jason -> Margaret. \"Brenda is Jason's ancestor.\" => Brenda -> Jason. \"Ronald is Barbara's ancestor.\" => Ronald -> Barbara. \"Michael is Andrew's ancestor.\" => Michael -> Andrew. \"Julia is Andrew's descendant.\" => Andrew -> Julia. \"Diana is John's ancestor.\" => Diana -> John. \"John is Katherine's ancestor.\" => John -> Katherine. \"Bruce is Katherine's descendant.\" => Katherine -> Bruce. \"Raymond is Abigail's ancestor.\" => Raymond -> Abigail. \"Janice is Albert's ancestor.\" => Janice -> Albert. \"Shirley is Albert's descendant.\" => Albert -> Shirley. \"Jerry is Diane's ancestor.\" => Jerry -> Diane. \"Lori is Danielle's ancestor.\" => Danielle -> Lori? Actually \"Danielle is Lori's descendant.\" => Lori -> Danielle. So we have many edges.\n\nThus the ancestors of Bradley are: Donald, Carolyn, Paul, Samuel, Keith, ... etc. Let's compute ancestors of Bradley systematically.\n\nGiven the directed edges (ancestor->descendant), we can compute ancestors of each node.\n\nBut perhaps there is a more direct approach: Since the chain we found is a path connecting Donna and Eugene via many intermediate nodes, and each intermediate node is an ancestor of Donna (as we argued). However, we need to check if any of those intermediate nodes are ancestors of Eugene. Since Eugene's ancestors are nodes that have a directed path to Eugene (i.e., nodes that are ancestors of Eugene). The only immediate ancestor is Bradley, and then its ancestors include Donald, etc. So we need to see if any node in the chain (except perhaps some) is an ancestor of Eugene. If any node is an ancestor of both Donna and Eugene, then they share a common ancestor.\n\nFrom the chain, we have many nodes: Donna, Alexis, Sara, Natalie, Ethan, Danielle, Lori, Diane, Jerry, Shirley, Albert, Janice, Abigail, Raymond, Bruce, Katherine, John, Diana, Julia, Andrew, Michael, Barbara, Ronald, Brenda, Jason, Margaret, Wayne, Zachary, Harold, Christian, Kayla, Thomas, Richard, Kelly, George, Mark, Julie, Henry, Joyce, Gary, Jacob, Brian, Victoria, Eric, Russell, Rachel, Jack, Jeffrey, Evelyn, Teresa, Lawrence, Michelle, Joshua, Kimberly, Gerald, Karen, Joe, Keith, Samuel, Paul, Carolyn, Donald, Bradley, Eugene.\n\nNow, which of these are ancestors of Eugene? Let's list ancestors of Eugene: Starting from Eugene, we have incoming edge from Bradley. So Bradley is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Bradley, we have incoming edge from Donald. So Donald is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Donald, incoming edge from Carolyn. So Carolyn is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Carolyn, incoming edge from Paul. So Paul is ancestor of Eugene.

So Rachel is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Rachel, incoming edge from Russell. So Russell is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Russell, incoming edge from Eric. So Eric is ancestor of Eugene.

So Joyce is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Joyce, incoming edge from Henry. So Henry is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Henry, incoming edge from Julie. So Julie is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Julie, incoming edge from Mark. So Mark is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Mark, incoming edge from George. So George is ancestor of Eugene. Then from George, incoming edge from Kelly. So Kelly is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Kelly, incoming edge from Richard. So Richard is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Richard, incoming edge from Thomas. So Thomas is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Thomas, incoming edge from Kayla. So Kayla is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Kayla, incoming edge from Christian. So Christian is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Christian, incoming edge from Harold. So Harold is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Harold, incoming edge from Zachary. So Zachary is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Zachary, incoming edge from Wayne. So Wayne is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Wayne, incoming edge from Margaret. So Margaret is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Margaret, incoming edge from Jason. So Jason is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Jason, incoming edge from Brenda. So Brenda is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Brenda, incoming edge from Ronald. So Ronald is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Ronald, incoming edge from Barbara. So Barbara is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Barbara, incoming edge from Michael. So Michael is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Michael, incoming edge from Andrew. So Andrew is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Andrew, incoming edge from Julia. So Julia is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Julia, incoming edge from Diana. So Diana is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Diana, incoming edge from John. So John is ancestor of Eugene. Then from John, incoming edge from Katherine. So Katherine is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Katherine, incoming edge from Bruce. So Bruce is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Bruce, incoming edge from Raymond. So Raymond is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Raymond, incoming edge from Abigail. So Abigail is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Abigail, incoming edge from Janice. So Janice is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Janice, incoming edge from Albert. So Albert is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Albert, incoming edge from Shirley. So Shirley is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Shirley, incoming edge from Jerry. So Jerry is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Jerry, incoming edge from Diane. So Diane is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Diane, incoming edge from Lori. So Lori is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Lori, incoming edge from Danielle. So Danielle is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Danielle, incoming edge from Ethan. So Ethan is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Ethan, incoming edge from Natalie. So Natalie is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Natalie, incoming edge from Sara. So Sara is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Sara, incoming edge from Alexis. So Alexis is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Alexis, incoming edge from ??? Actually, we need to see if Alexis has any incoming edges. The only statement involving Alexis is \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" So Alexis is ancestor of Donna. Also \"Sara is Alexis's ancestor.\" So Sara is ancestor of Alexis. So Alexis has an incoming edge from Sara (Sara -> Alexis). So Alexis is descendant of Sara, which we already have. So the chain continues: Alexis is descendant of Sara, which is descendant of Natalie, etc. So eventually, we need to see if there is a path from some node to Donna. But we need to find if any node is ancestor of both Donna and Eugene.\n\nThus we see that many nodes are ancestors of Eugene. Indeed, the chain we listed includes many nodes that are ancestors of Eugene (starting from Bradley downwards). Let's verify: Are all nodes in the chain ancestors of Eugene? Let's check each node:\n\n- Donna: Not ancestor of Eugene, because Donna is descendant of Alexis, not ancestor of Eugene. Donna has no outgoing edges, so cannot be ancestor of Eugene.\n\n- Alexis: Alexis is ancestor of Donna (edge Alexis -> Donna). Does Alexis have a directed path to Eugene? Let's see: Is there a path from Alexis to Eugene? We need to see if there is a directed path from Alexis to any of the nodes that are ancestors of Eugene. Let's check if Alexis is ancestor of any of the nodes that are ancestors of Eugene. The chain of ancestors of Eugene includes many nodes, but we need to see if Alexis is in that chain. Let's see the chain we listed: Starting from Eugene, go to Bradley, then to Donald, then to Carolyn, then to Paul, then to Samuel, then to Keith, then to Joe, then to Karen, then to Gerald, then to Kimberly, then to Joshua, then to Michelle, then to Lawrence, then to Teresa, then to Evelyn, then to Jeffrey, then to Jack, then to Rachel, then to Russell, then to Eric, then to Victoria, then to Brian, then to Jacob, then to Gary, then to Joyce, then to Henry, then to Julie, then to Mark, then to George, then to Kelly, then to Richard, then to Thomas, then to Kayla, then to Christian, then to Harold, then to Zachary, then to Wayne, then to Margaret, then to Jason, then to Brenda, then to Ronald, then to Barbara, then to Michael, then to Andrew, then to Julia, then to Diana, then to John, then to Katherine, then to Bruce, then to Raymond, then to Abigail, then to Janice, then to Albert, then to Shirley, then to Jerry, then to Diane, then to Lori, then to Danielle, then to Ethan, then to Natalie, then to Sara, then to Alexis, then to ??? (maybe some other node). So Alexis appears in the chain of ancestors of Eugene. Indeed, we have a path: Eugene <- Bradley <- Donald <- ... <- Alexis (via many steps). So Alexis is an ancestor of Eugene. Let's verify: The chain we listed shows that Alexis is ancestor of Eugene, because we have a path from Alexis to Eugene via many steps. Actually, we need to check the direction of edges for each step. Let's verify the chain from Alexis to Eugene: Starting from Alexis, we have \"Alexis is descendant of Sara.\" So Sara -> Alexis. Then \"Sara is descendant of Natalie.\" So Natalie -> Sara. Then \"Natalie is descendant of Ethan.\" So Ethan -> Natalie. Then \"Ethan is descendant of Danielle.\" So Danielle -> Ethan. Then \"Danielle is descendant of Lori.\" So Lori -> Danielle. Then \"Lori is descendant of Diane.\" So Diane -> Lori. Then \"Diane is descendant of Jerry.\" So Jerry -> Diane. Then \"Jerry is descendant of Shirley.\" So Shirley -> Jerry. Then \"Shirley is descendant of Albert.\" So Albert -> Shirley. Then \"Albert is descendant of Janice.\" So Janice -> Albert. Then \"Janice is descendant of Abigail.\" So Abigail -> Janice. Then \"Abigail is descendant of Raymond.\" So Raymond -> Abigail. Then \"Raymond is descendant of Bruce.\" So Bruce -> Raymond. Then \"Bruce is descendant of Katherine.\" So Katherine -> Bruce. Then \"Katherine is descendant of John.\" So John -> Katherine. Then \"John is descendant of Diana.\" So Diana -> John. Then \"Diana is descendant of Julia.\" So Julia -> Diana. Then \"Julia is descendant of Andrew.\" So Andrew -> Julia. Then \"Andrew is descendant of Michael.\" So Michael -> Andrew. Then \"Michael is descendant of Barbara.\" So Barbara -> Michael. Then \"Barbara is descendant of Ronald.\" So Ronald -> Barbara. Then \"Ronald is descendant of Brenda.\" So Brenda -> Ronald. Then \"Brenda is descendant of Jason.\" So Jason -> Brenda. Then \"Jason is descendant of Margaret.\" So Margaret -> Jason. Then \"Margaret is descendant of Wayne.\" So Wayne -> Margaret. Then \"Wayne is descendant of Zachary.\" So Zachary -> Wayne. Then \"Zachary is descendant of Harold.\" So Harold -> Zachary. Then \"Harold is descendant of Christian.\" So Christian -> Harold. Then \"Christian is descendant of Kayla.\" So Kayla -> Christian. Then \"Kayla is descendant of Thomas.\" So Thomas -> Kayla. Then \"Thomas is descendant of Richard.\" So Richard -> Thomas. Then \"Richard is descendant of Kelly.\" So Kelly -> Richard. Then \"Kelly is descendant of George.\" So George -> Kelly. Then \"George is descendant of Mark.\" So Mark -> George. Then \"Mark is descendant of Julie.\" So Julie -> Mark. Then \"Julie is descendant of Henry.\" So Henry -> Julie. Then \"Henry is descendant of Joyce.\" So Joyce -> Henry. Then \"Joyce is descendant of Gary.\" So Gary -> Joyce. Then \"Gary is descendant of Jacob.\" So Jacob -> Gary. Then \"Jacob is descendant of Brian.\" So Brian -> Jacob. Then \"Brian is descendant of Victoria.\" So Victoria -> Brian. Then \"Victoria is descendant of Eric.\" So Eric -> Victoria. Then \"Eric is descendant of Russell.\" So Russell -> Eric. Then \"Russell is descendant of Rachel.\" So Rachel -> Russell. Then \"Rachel is descendant of Jack.\" So Jack -> Rachel. Then \"Jack is descendant of Jeffrey.\" So Jeffrey -> Jack. Then \"Jeffrey is descendant of Evelyn.\" So Evelyn -> Jeffrey. Then \"Evelyn is descendant of Teresa.\" So Teresa -> Evelyn. Then \"Teresa is descendant of Lawrence.\" So Lawrence -> Teresa. Then \"Lawrence is descendant of Michelle.\" So Michelle -> Lawrence. Then \"Michelle is descendant of Joshua.\" So Joshua -> Michelle. Then \"Joshua is descendant of Kimberly.\" So Kimberly -> Joshua. Then \"Kimberly is descendant of Gerald.\" So Gerald -> Kimberly. Then \"Gerald is descendant of Karen.\" So Karen -> Gerald. Then \"Karen is descendant of Joe.\" So Joe -> Karen. Then \"Joe is descendant of Keith.\" So Keith -> Joe. Then \"Keith is descendant of Samuel.\" So Samuel -> Keith. Then \"Samuel is descendant of Paul.\" So Paul -> Samuel. Then \"Paul is descendant of Carolyn.\" So Carolyn -> Paul. Then \"Carolyn is descendant of Donald.\" So Donald -> Carolyn. Then \"Donald is descendant of Bradley.\" So Bradley -> Donald. Then \"Bradley is descendant of Eugene.\" So Eugene -> Bradley. Wait, this is the opposite: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley -> Eugene (ancestor to descendant). So the direction is Bradley -> Eugene. So we have a directed path from Bradley to Eugene. But we have a directed path from Eugene to Bradley? No, we have edge from Bradley to Eugene. So moving from Eugene to Bradley is opposite direction. So we cannot go from Alexis to Eugene via directed edges following the direction we just described. Actually, we need to check the direction for each step in the chain from Alexis to Eugene. Let's list the directed edges for each step:\n\n- Alexis -> Donna (Alexis ancestor of Donna). So edge Alexis -> Donna.\n\n- Sara -> Alexis (Sara ancestor of Alexis). So edge Sara -> Alexis.\n\n- Natalie -> Sara (Natalie ancestor of Sara). So edge Natalie -> Sara.\n\n- Ethan -> Natalie (Ethan ancestor of Natalie). So edge Ethan -> Natalie.\n\n- Danielle -> Ethan (Danielle ancestor of Ethan). So edge Danielle -> Ethan.\n\n- Lori -> Danielle (Lori ancestor of Danielle). So edge Lori -> Danielle.\n\n- Diane -> Lori (Diane ancestor of Lori). So edge Diane -> Lori.\n\n- Jerry -> Diane (Jerry ancestor of Diane). So edge Jerry -> Diane.\n\n- Shirley -> Jerry (Shirley ancestor of Jerry). So edge Shirley -> Jerry.\n\n- Albert -> Shirley (Albert ancestor of Shirley). So edge Albert -> Shirley.\n\n- Janice -> Albert (Janice ancestor of Albert). So edge Janice -> Albert.\n\n- Abigail -> Janice (Abigail ancestor of Janice).

So edge Bruce -> Raymond.\n\n- Katherine -> Bruce (Katherine ancestor of Bruce). So edge Katherine -> Bruce.\n\n- John -> Katherine (John ancestor of Katherine). So edge John -> Katherine.\n\n- Diana -> John (Diana ancestor of John). So edge Diana -> John.\n\n- Julia -> Diana (Julia ancestor of Diana). So edge Julia -> Diana.\n\n- Andrew -> Julia (Andrew ancestor of Julia). So edge Andrew -> Julia.\n\n- Michael -> Andrew (Michael ancestor of Andrew). So edge Michael -> Andrew.\n\n- Barbara -> Michael (Barbara ancestor of Michael). So edge Barbara -> Michael.\n\n- Ronald -> Barbara (Ronald ancestor of Barbara). So edge Ronald -> Barbara.\n\n- Brenda -> Ronald (Brenda ancestor of Ronald). So edge Brenda -> Ronald.\n\n- Jason -> Brenda (Jason ancestor of Brenda). So edge Jason -> Brenda.\n\n- Margaret -> Jason (Margaret ancestor of Jason). So edge Margaret -> Jason.\n\n- Wayne -> Margaret (Wayne ancestor of Margaret). So edge Wayne -> Margaret.\n\n- Zachary -> Wayne (Zachary ancestor of Wayne). So edge Zachary -> Wayne.\n\n- Harold -> Zachary (Harold ancestor of Zachary). So edge Harold -> Zachary.\n\n- Christian -> Harold (Christian ancestor of Harold). So edge Christian -> Harold.\n\n- Kayla -> Christian (Kayla ancestor of Christian). So edge Kayla -> Christian.\n\n- Thomas -> Kayla (Thomas ancestor of Kayla). So edge Thomas -> Kayla.\n\n- Richard -> Thomas (Richard ancestor of Thomas). So edge Richard -> Thomas.\n\n- Kelly -> Richard (Kelly ancestor of Richard). So edge Kelly -> Richard.\n\n- George -> Kelly (George ancestor of Kelly). So edge George -> Kelly.\n\n- Mark -> George (Mark ancestor of George). So edge Mark -> George.\n\n- Julie -> Mark (Julie ancestor of Mark). So edge Julie -> Mark.\n\n- Henry -> Julie (Henry ancestor of Julie). So edge Henry -> Julie.\n\n- Joyce -> Henry (Joyce ancestor of Henry). So edge Joyce -> Henry.\n\n- Gary -> Joyce (Gary ancestor of Joyce). So edge Gary -> Joyce.\n\n- Jacob -> Gary (Jacob ancestor of Gary). So edge Jacob -> Gary.\n\n- Brian -> Jacob (Brian ancestor of Jacob). So edge Brian -> Jacob.\n\n- Victoria -> Brian (Victoria ancestor of Brian). So edge Victoria -> Brian.\n\n- Eric -> Victoria (Eric ancestor of Victoria). So edge Eric -> Victoria.\n\n- Russell -> Eric (Russell ancestor of Eric). So edge Russell -> Eric.\n\n- Rachel -> Russell (Rachel ancestor of Russell). So edge Rachel -> Russell.\n\n- Jack -> Rachel (Jack ancestor of Rachel). So edge Jack -> Rachel.\n\n- Jeffrey -> Jack (Jeffrey ancestor of Jack). So edge Jeffrey -> Jack.\n\n- Evelyn -> Jeffrey (Evelyn ancestor of Jeffrey). So edge Evelyn -> Jeffrey.\n\n- Teresa -> Evelyn (Teresa ancestor of Evelyn). So edge Teresa -> Evelyn.\n\n- Lawrence -> Teresa (Lawrence ancestor of Teresa). So edge Lawrence -> Teresa.\n\n- Michelle -> Lawrence (Michelle ancestor of Lawrence). So edge Michelle -> Lawrence.\n\n- Joshua -> Michelle (Joshua ancestor of Michelle). So edge Joshua -> Michelle.\n\n- Kimberly -> Joshua (Kimberly ancestor of Joshua). So edge Kimberly -> Joshua.\n\n- Gerald -> Kimberly (Gerald ancestor of Kimberly). So edge Gerald -> Kimberly.\n\n- Karen -> Gerald (Karen ancestor of Gerald). So edge Karen -> Gerald.\n\n- Joe -> Karen (Joe ancestor of Karen). So edge Joe -> Karen.\n\n- Keith -> Joe (Keith ancestor of Joe). So edge Keith -> Joe.\n\n- Samuel -> Keith (Samuel ancestor of Keith). So edge Samuel -> Keith.\n\n- Paul -> Samuel (Paul ancestor of Samuel). So edge Paul -> Samuel.\n\n- Carolyn -> Paul (Carolyn ancestor of Paul). So edge Carolyn -> Paul.\n\n- Donald -> Carolyn (Donald ancestor of Carolyn). So edge Donald -> Carolyn.\n\n- Bradley -> Donald (Bradley ancestor of Donald). So edge Bradley -> Donald.\n\n- Eugene -> Bradley (Eugene is descendant of Bradley). Actually, the statement \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So edge Bradley -> Eugene (ancestor to descendant). So we have edge Bradley -> Eugene.\n\nThus the directed edges are from ancestor to descendant as listed.\n\nNow, we can see a directed path from Alexis to Eugene? Let's see: Starting from Alexis, we have edge Alexis -> Donna (to Donna). Then from Donna, there is no outgoing edge (Donna has no statements where Donna is ancestor). So we cannot go further. So Alexis cannot be ancestor of Eugene (since there's no path from Alexis to Eugene). However, we could go from Alexis upstream (to its ancestors) but that would be opposite direction.\n\nThus the directed path from any node to Eugene must follow the direction of edges (ancestor to descendant). So to find common ancestors of both Donna and Eugene, we need to find nodes that have directed paths to both Donna and Eugene. Let's find all ancestors of Donna (i.e., nodes that have directed paths to Donna). Since Donna has only incoming edge from Alexis (Alexis -> Donna). So the only direct ancestor of Donna is Alexis. Then any node that is ancestor of Alexis (i.e., has a directed path to Alexis) is also an ancestor of Donna (by transitivity). So we need to find all nodes that have directed paths to Alexis.\n\nWe have edges: Sara -> Alexis, Natalie -> Sara, Ethan -> Natalie, Danielle -> Ethan, Lori -> Danielle, Diane -> Lori, Jerry -> Diane, Shirley -> Jerry, Albert -> Shirley, Janice -> Albert, Abigail -> Janice, Raymond -> Abigail, Bruce -> Raymond, Katherine -> Bruce, John -> Katherine, Diana -> John, Julia -> Diana, Andrew -> Julia, Michael -> Andrew, Barbara -> Michael, Ronald -> Barbara, Brenda -> Ronald, Jason -> Brenda, Margaret -> Jason, Wayne -> Margaret, Zachary -> Wayne, Harold -> Zachary, Christian -> Harold, Kayla -> Christian, Thomas -> Kayla, Richard -> Thomas, Kelly -> Richard, George -> Kelly, Mark -> George, Julie -> Mark, Henry -> Julie, Joyce -> Henry, Gary -> Joyce, Jacob -> Gary, Brian -> Jacob, Victoria -> Brian, Eric -> Victoria, Russell -> Eric, Rachel -> Russell, Jack -> Rachel, Jeffrey -> Jack, Evelyn -> Jeffrey, Teresa -> Evelyn, Lawrence -> Teresa, Michelle -> Lawrence, Joshua -> Michelle, Kimberly -> Joshua, Gerald -> Kimberly, Karen -> Gerald, Joe -> Karen, Keith -> Joe, Samuel -> Keith, Paul -> Samuel, Carolyn -> Paul, Donald -> Carolyn, Bradley -> Donald, Eugene -> Bradley? Wait, the edge is Bradley -> Eugene. So there is no edge from Eugene to Bradley. So the directed path from any node to Eugene must end with Bradley -> Eugene. So the ancestors of Eugene are all nodes that have a directed path to Bradley (including Bradley). So we need to find nodes that have directed path to both Donna (i.e., to Alexis) and to Bradley. However, we see that the directed graph is a huge tree (or DAG) where each node has a unique parent? Not necessarily; there may be multiple parents.\n\nBut we need to find a node that is ancestor of both Donna and Eugene. Since Donna's only ancestors are nodes that can reach Alexis (including Alexis, Sara, Natalie, etc.), and Eugene's ancestors are nodes that can reach Bradley (including Bradley, Donald, etc.). So we need to find a node that is both an ancestor of Alexis (i.e., can reach Alexis) and an ancestor of Bradley (i.e., can reach Bradley). If such a node exists, then Donna and Eugene share a common ancestor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a node that is a common ancestor of both Donna and Eugene (i.e., there is a node X such that X has directed paths to both Donna and Eugene). Let's examine the directed graph.\n\nGiven the chain we listed (the directed edges), we see that the graph seems to be a long chain (almost a linear chain) but with some branching? Let's examine the edges more closely.\n\nThe edges we listed are all from older to younger (ancestor to descendant). The chain appears to be a linear chain: each node appears as a child of exactly one parent, except maybe some nodes have multiple children? Let's check.\n\nWe have many nodes, but each node appears in exactly one \"X is Y's ancestor\" statement (as X) and maybe also in \"Z is Y's descendant\" statements (as Y). For each node, there may be multiple outgoing edges (if it is ancestor of multiple people). Let's examine the graph to see if it's a tree.\n\nList all statements again with the directed edges:\n\n1.

Ethan is Natalie's ancestor. => Ethan -> Natalie (E->N)\n\nNow we have a directed graph.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Donna and Eugene. Let's compute the ancestors (i.e., reachable nodes) for each.\n\nFirst, compute ancestors of Donna (i.e., nodes that can reach Donna via directed edges). Starting from Donna, we follow reverse edges (i.e., go to its parent(s)). Donna has incoming edge from Alexis (Alexis -> Donna). So Alexis is a direct ancestor. Alexis also has incoming edge from Sara (Sara -> Alexis). So Sara is ancestor. Sara has incoming edge from Natalie (Natalie -> Sara). So Natalie is ancestor. Natalie has incoming edge from Ethan (Ethan -> Natalie). So Ethan is ancestor. Ethan has incoming edge from Danielle (Danielle -> Ethan). So Danielle is ancestor. Danielle has incoming edge from Lori (Lori -> Danielle). So Lori is ancestor. Lori has incoming edge from Diane (Diane -> Lori). So Diane is ancestor. Diane has incoming edge from Jerry (Jerry -> Diane). So Jerry is ancestor. Jerry has incoming edge from Shirley (Shirley -> Jerry). So Shirley is ancestor. Shirley has incoming edge from Albert (Albert -> Shirley). So Albert is ancestor. Albert has incoming edge from Janice (Janice -> Albert). So Janice is ancestor. Janice has incoming edge from Abigail (Abigail -> Janice). So Abigail is ancestor. Abigail has incoming edge from Raymond (Raymond -> Abigail). So Raymond is ancestor. Raymond has incoming edge from Bruce (Bruce -> Raymond). So Bruce is ancestor. Bruce has incoming edge from Katherine (Katherine -> Bruce). So Katherine is ancestor. Katherine has incoming edge from John (John -> Katherine). So John is ancestor. John has incoming edge from Diana (Diana -> John). So Diana is ancestor. Diana has incoming edge from Julia (Julia -> Diana). So Julia is ancestor. Julia has incoming edge from Andrew (Andrew -> Julia). So Andrew is ancestor. Andrew has incoming edge from Michael (Michael -> Andrew). So Michael is ancestor. Michael has incoming edge from Barbara (Barbara -> Michael). So Barbara is ancestor. Barbara has incoming edge from Ronald (Ronald -> Barbara). So Ronald is ancestor. Ronald has incoming edge from Brenda (Brenda -> Ronald). So Brenda is ancestor. Brenda has incoming edge from Jason (Jason -> Brenda). So Jason is ancestor. Jason has incoming edge from Margaret (Margaret -> Jason). So Margaret is ancestor. Margaret has incoming edge from Wayne (Wayne -> Margaret). So Wayne is ancestor. Wayne has incoming edge from Zachary (Zachary -> Wayne). So Zachary is ancestor. Zachary has incoming edge from Harold (Harold -> Zachary). So Harold is ancestor. Harold has incoming edge from Christian (Christian -> Harold). So Christian is ancestor. Christian has incoming edge from Kayla (Kayla -> Christian). So Kayla is ancestor. Kayla has incoming edge from Thomas (Thomas -> Kayla). So Thomas is ancestor. Thomas has incoming edge from Richard (Richard -> Thomas). So Richard is ancestor. Richard has incoming edge from Kelly (Kelly -> Richard). So Kelly is ancestor. Kelly has incoming edge from George (George -> Kelly). So George is ancestor. George has incoming edge from Mark (Mark -> George). So Mark is ancestor. Mark has incoming edge from Julie (Julie -> Mark). So Julie is ancestor. Julie has incoming edge from Henry (Henry -> Julie). So Henry is ancestor. Henry has incoming edge from Joyce (Joyce -> Henry). So Joyce is ancestor. Joyce has incoming edge from Gary (Gary -> Joyce). So Gary is ancestor. Gary has incoming edge from Jacob (Jacob -> Gary). So Jacob is ancestor. Jacob has incoming edge from Brian (Brian -> Jacob). So Brian is ancestor. Brian has incoming edge from Victoria (Victoria -> Brian). So Victoria is ancestor. Victoria has incoming edge from Eric (Eric -> Victoria). So Eric is ancestor. Eric has incoming edge from Russell (Russell -> Eric). So Russell is ancestor. Russell has incoming edge from Rachel (Rachel -> Russell). So Rachel is ancestor. Rachel has incoming edge from Jack (Jack -> Rachel). So Jack is ancestor. Jack has incoming edge from Jeffrey (Jeffrey -> Jack). So Jeffrey is ancestor. Jeffrey has incoming edge from Evelyn (Evelyn -> Jeffrey). So Evelyn is ancestor. Evelyn has incoming edge from Teresa (Teresa -> Evelyn). So Teresa is ancestor. Teresa has incoming edge from Lawrence (Lawrence -> Teresa). So Lawrence is ancestor. Lawrence has incoming edge from Michelle (Michelle -> Lawrence). So Michelle is ancestor. Michelle has incoming edge from Joshua (Joshua -> Michelle). So Joshua is ancestor. Joshua has incoming edge from Kimberly (Kimberly -> Joshua). So Kimberly is ancestor. Kimberly has incoming edge from Gerald (Gerald -> Kimberly). So Gerald is ancestor. Gerald has incoming edge from Karen (Karen -> Gerald). So Karen is ancestor. Karen has incoming edge from Joe (Joe -> Karen). So Joe is ancestor. Joe has incoming edge from Keith (Keith -> Joe). So Keith is ancestor. Keith has incoming edge from Samuel (Samuel -> Keith). So Samuel is ancestor. Samuel has incoming edge from Paul (Paul -> Samuel). So Paul is ancestor. Paul has incoming edge from Carolyn (Carolyn -> Paul). So Carolyn is ancestor. Carolyn has incoming edge from Donald (Donald -> Carolyn). So Donald is ancestor. Donald has incoming edge from Bradley (Bradley -> Donald). So Bradley is ancestor. Bradley has incoming edge from ??? Actually, Bradley's only parent is ??? Let's check: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Donald -> Bradley. So Bradley has incoming edge from Donald. So that's it. So the ancestors of Donna include all these nodes, up to Bradley and beyond? Actually, after Bradley, there is no further parent (Bradley has only incoming edge from Donald). So the ancestors of Donna include Bradley, Donald, etc., all the way up to maybe some root (maybe no root). So the ancestors of Donna are all nodes in the chain we listed: from Bradley upwards? Wait, we listed ancestors of Donna by following incoming edges from Donna up to the root. So we started at Donna and moved upward: Donna -> Alexis -> Sara -> Natalie -> Ethan -> Danielle -> Lori -> Diane -> Jerry -> Shirley -> Albert -> Janice -> Abigail -> Raymond -> Bruce -> Katherine -> John -> Diana -> Julia -> Andrew -> Michael -> Barbara -> Ronald -> Brenda -> Jason -> Margaret -> Wayne -> Zachary -> Harold -> Christian -> Kayla -> Thomas -> Richard -> Kelly -> George -> Mark -> Julie -> Henry -> Joyce -> Gary -> Jacob -> Brian -> Victoria -> Eric -> Russell -> Rachel -> Jack -> Jeffrey -> Evelyn -> Teresa -> Lawrence -> Michelle -> Joshua -> Kimberly -> Gerald -> Karen -> Joe -> Keith -> Samuel -> Paul -> Carolyn -> Donald -> Bradley (and then maybe stop because Bradley has no parent except Donald). Actually, Bradley has incoming edge from Donald. So after Bradley, we go to Donald, then to Carolyn, etc. So the ancestors of Donna include Bradley, Donald, Carolyn, Paul, Samuel, Keith, etc., all the way up to the root. So the ancestors of Donna include many nodes, including Bradley and Donald, etc. So indeed, Bradley and Donald are ancestors of Donna. Thus we have a directed path from Bradley to Donna: Bradley -> Donald -> Carolyn -> Paul -> Samuel -> Keith -> ... -> eventually to Donna? Wait, we need to verify that there is a directed path from Bradley to Donna following edges from ancestor to descendant. Let's see: Starting from Bradley, we have edge Bradley -> Donald (since Donald is descendant of Bradley). Actually, \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" Wait, that is \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So edge Donald -> Bradley? Let's double-check: The statement \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" Means Donald is ancestor of Bradley. So edge Donald -> Bradley (ancestor to descendant). Wait, we need to be careful: The statement \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" Means Donald is ancestor of Bradley. So edge Donald -> Bradley (Donald is ancestor, Bradley is descendant). So the direction is Donald -> Bradley. So Bradley is descendant of Donald. So the edge is Donald -> Bradley. So we have edge Donald -> Bradley. So from Bradley we cannot go to Donald (since edge is incoming to Bradley). So we cannot follow a path from Bradley to Donna via forward edges. But we can follow a path from Donald to Bradley (Donald -> Bradley) and then to ??? But we need a path from Donald to Donna. Let's see if there is a directed path from Donald to Donna. Starting from Donald, we have edge Donald -> Bradley (since Donald is ancestor of Bradley). Then from Bradley, we have edge Bradley -> Eugene? Actually, \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So edge Bradley -> Eugene. So from Bradley we can go to Eugene. Then from Eugene, no outgoing edges. So we cannot go further. So Donald cannot reach Donna via forward edges.\n\nThus the ancestors of Donna we listed are all nodes that have a directed path to Donna (i.e., they are ancestors). However, we need to verify that each of those nodes indeed has a directed path to Donna. Let's check a few: Starting from Donald, does Donald have a directed path to Donna? We have Donald -> Bradley -> ??? Actually, we need to see if there is a path from Donald to Donna. Let's examine the directed edges for each node:\n\n- Donald -> Bradley (Donald is ancestor of Bradley). Then from Bradley, we have edge Bradley -> Eugene (Bradley is ancestor of Eugene). Then from Eugene, no outgoing edges. So Donald cannot reach Donna via forward edges. So Donald is not an ancestor of Donna in the directed sense. Wait, but earlier we said Donna's ancestors include Donald, because we followed reverse edges (i.e., we started at Donna and went backward along edges). However, the reverse direction does not guarantee that the nodes we reach are ancestors of Donna in the forward sense (i.e., they have a directed path to Donna). Actually, they do: If we go backward from Donna to its parent(s) (incoming edges), those nodes are indeed ancestors of Donna (since there is a directed edge from them to Donna). For example, Alexis -> Donna is a directed edge. So Alexis is an ancestor of Donna. Then from Alexis, we have an incoming edge from Sara (Sara -> Alexis). So there is a directed edge from Sara to Alexis, and from Alexis to Donna. So there is a path Sara -> Alexis -> Donna. So Sara is an ancestor of Donna. Similarly, we can trace back: Starting from Donna, we go to Alexis, then to Sara, then to Natalie, etc. So each step we go to a node that has a directed edge to the previous node. So the chain we traced is indeed a directed path from each ancestor to the next, eventually to Donna. So all those nodes are ancestors of Donna in the directed sense.\n\nThus the ancestors of Donna are exactly the nodes we listed (including Bradley, Donald, etc.) because we can follow the chain from each node to Donna via the directed edges we listed. Let's verify for Donald: Does Donald have a directed path to Donna? Let's see: Donald -> ??? We need to find a path from Donald to Donna. Starting from Donald, we have edge Donald -> Bradley? Wait, we need to check the direction again: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" Means Donald is ancestor of Bradley. So edge Donald -> Bradley (ancestor to descendant). So from Donald we go to Bradley. Then from Bradley, we have edge Bradley -> Eugene (Bradley ancestor of Eugene). But we need to go from Bradley to a node that leads to Donna. However, we need to see if there is a path from Bradley to Donna. In the chain we traced from Donna upward, we saw that after Bradley, we go to Donald, then to Carolyn, etc. But that was moving backward (i.e., from Donna to Bradley via reverse edges). Let's examine the chain again: Starting at Donna, we go to Alexis (incoming edge). Then to Sara (incoming). Then to Natalie (incoming). Then to Ethan (incoming). Then to Danielle (incoming). Then to Lori (incoming). Then to Diane (incoming). Then to Jerry (incoming). Then to Shirley (incoming). Then to Albert (incoming). Then to Janice (incoming). Then to Abigail (incoming). Then to Raymond (incoming). Then to Bruce (incoming). Then to Katherine (incoming). Then to John (incoming). Then to Diana (incoming). Then to Julia (incoming). Then to Andrew (incoming). Then to Michael (incoming). Then to Barbara (incoming). Then to Ronald (incoming). Then to Brenda (incoming). Then to Jason (incoming). Then to Margaret (incoming). Then to Wayne (incoming). Then to Zachary (incoming). Then to Harold (incoming). Then to Christian (incoming). Then to Kayla (incoming). Then to Thomas (incoming). Then to Richard (incoming). Then to Kelly (incoming). Then to George (incoming). Then to Mark (incoming). Then to Julie (incoming). Then to Henry (incoming). Then to Joyce (incoming). Then to Gary (incoming). Then to Jacob (incoming). Then to Brian (incoming). Then to Victoria (incoming). Then to Eric (incoming). Then to Russell (incoming). Then to Rachel (incoming). Then to Jack (incoming). Then to Jeffrey (incoming). Then to Evelyn (incoming). Then to Teresa (incoming). Then to Lawrence (incoming). Then to Michelle (incoming). Then to Joshua (incoming). Then to Kimberly (incoming). Then to Gerald (incoming). Then to Karen (incoming). Then to Joe (incoming). Then to Keith (incoming). Then to Samuel (incoming). Then to Paul (incoming). Then to Carolyn (incoming). Then to Donald (incoming). Then to Bradley (incoming). Then we stop because Bradley has no incoming edges? Actually, Bradley has incoming edge from Donald (since Donald is ancestor of Bradley). So we can continue: After Bradley, we go to Donald, then to Carolyn, then to Paul, then to Samuel, etc. Actually, we need to see if there is an incoming edge to Bradley from someone else? The statement \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Donald -> Bradley. So there is an incoming edge to Bradley from Donald. So we can continue: from Bradley we go to Donald (since Donald is ancestor of Bradley). But that would be moving upward to Donald (i.e., following reverse edges). However, we need to check if there is a directed path from Donald to Donna. Let's examine the directed edges for each node:\n\nWe have edges:\n\n- Donald -> Bradley (Donald is ancestor of Bradley).\n- Bradley -> ??? Actually, \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley -> Eugene (Bradley ancestor of Eugene). So Bradley has outgoing edge to Eugene.\n- Donald also has outgoing edge to ... Actually, Donald is also descendant of Bradley? No, Donald is ancestor of Bradley, so Bradley is descendant of Donald. So the edge is Donald -> Bradley. So Donald's outgoing edges: Donald -> Bradley. Also Donald is descendant of ??? Actually, Donald is also descendant of ??? Let's see: \"Donald is Carolyn's descendant.\" Means Carolyn -> Donald (Carolyn ancestor of Donald). So Donald also has incoming edge from Carolyn. So Donald has outgoing edge to Bradley, incoming edge from Carolyn.\n\nThus the directed graph is a DAG (or maybe with cycles). Let's try to see if there is a directed path from Donald to Donna. Starting from Donald, we can go to Bradley. Then from Bradley, we can go to Eugene. Then from Eugene, no outgoing edges. So no path to Donna. So Donald cannot reach Donna via directed edges. But earlier we said Donald is an ancestor of Donna because we went backwards from Donna to Donald. However, that path is reversed: we went from Donna to Donald via reverse edges (i.e., we traversed edges in opposite direction). So Donald is not a directed ancestor of Donna; rather, Donna is a descendant of Donald? Wait, we need to be careful.\n\nThe concept of \"ancestor\" is directional: If there is a directed path from X to Y, then X is an ancestor of Y (X older, Y descendant). So if we have a directed edge from X to Y (X ancestor of Y), then X is an ancestor of Y, and Y is a descendant of X. So if we have a directed edge from Alexis to Donna, then Alexis is ancestor of Donna. If we have a directed edge from Sara to Alexis, then Sara is ancestor of Alexis (and thus ancestor of Donna). So the chain we traced backwards from Donna to Sara, Natalie, etc., is indeed a chain of directed edges from those nodes to Donna (i.e., each node has a directed edge to the next node, eventually to Donna). So those nodes are ancestors of Donna in the directed sense. But we need to check if Donald appears in that chain. In the chain we traced backwards from Donna, we eventually reached Donald? Let's see: After Bradley, we had Donald (since Donald is ancestor of Bradley). Actually, we need to check the direction: The chain we traced backwards from Donna included \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So we have edge Donald -> Bradley. So Donald is ancestor of Bradley. Since we traced from Donna to Bradley (by following reverse edges), we then went to Donald because Donald is ancestor of Bradley (i.e., there is a directed edge from Donald to Bradley). But we need to confirm: The reverse of that edge is from Bradley to Donald (i.e., we can go from Bradley to Donald by following reverse direction). But in the forward direction, Donald -> Bradley. So moving from Bradley to Donald is moving opposite direction of the edge (i.e., backward). So in the reverse traversal, we go from Bradley to Donald (which is moving backward). So Donald appears in the reverse chain, but not as an ancestor of Donna in the forward sense. Because to be an ancestor of Donna, there must be a directed path from Donald to Donna. But we have no such path: Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene. No path to Donna.\n\nThus the ancestors of Donna are those nodes that have directed paths to Donna, not those that can be reached by reverse traversal from Donna. The reverse traversal from Donna to a node does not guarantee that the node is an ancestor of Donna; it only guarantees that the node is reachable by following reverse edges (i.e., there is a path from the node to Donna in the forward direction? Actually, if we go from Donna to a node via reverse edges, that means there is a forward edge from that node to the previous node. So if we go Donna -> Alexis (reverse), we have edge Alexis -> Donna in forward direction. So Alexis is ancestor of Donna. Then we go from Alexis to Sara (reverse), we have edge Sara -> Alexis in forward direction, so Sara is ancestor of Alexis, and thus ancestor of Donna. So each step in the reverse traversal corresponds to a forward edge from the node to the previous node. So indeed, each node we encounter in the reverse traversal is an ancestor of Donna. So we need to verify that for each step, there is a forward edge from the new node to the previous node. For the step from Bradley to Donald, we have forward edge Donald -> Bradley (Donald ancestor of Bradley). So Donald is ancestor of Bradley. Since Bradley is an ancestor of Donna? Wait, is Bradley an ancestor of Donna? Let's check: In the reverse traversal, we have Donna -> ... -> Bradley (by reverse edges). That means there is a forward path from Bradley to Donna? Actually, if we go from Donna to Bradley via reverse edges, we need to verify that each reverse step corresponds to a forward edge from the new node to the previous node. Let's check the steps:\n\n- Starting from Donna, we go to Alexis: forward edge Alexis -> Donna.\n\n- Then we go to Sara: forward edge Sara -> Alexis.\n\n- Then we go to Natalie: forward edge Natalie -> Sara.\n\n- Then we go to Ethan: forward edge Ethan -> Natalie.\n\n- Then we go to Danielle: forward edge Danielle -> Ethan.\n\n- Then we go to Lori: forward edge Lori -> Danielle.\n\n- Then we go to Diane: forward edge Diane -> Lori.\n\n- Then we go to Jerry: forward edge Jerry -> Diane.\n\n- Then we go to Shirley: forward edge Shirley -> Jerry.\n\n- Then we go to Albert: forward edge Albert -> Shirley.\n\n- Then we go to Janice: forward edge Janice -> Albert.\n\n- Then we go to Abigail: forward edge Abigail -> Janice.\n\n- Then we go to Raymond: forward edge Raymond -> Abigail.\n\n- Then we go to Bruce: forward edge Bruce -> Raymond.\n\n- Then we go to Katherine: forward edge Katherine -> Bruce.\n\n- Then we go to John: forward edge John -> Katherine.\n\n- Then we go to Diana: forward edge Diana -> John.\n\n- Then we go to Julia: forward edge Julia -> Diana.\n\n- Then we go to Andrew: forward edge Andrew -> Julia.\n\n- Then we go to Michael: forward edge Michael -> Andrew.\n\n- Then we go to Barbara: forward edge Barbara -> Michael.\n\n- Then we go to Ronald: forward edge Ronald -> Barbara.\n\n- Then we go to Brenda: forward edge Brenda -> Ronald.\n\n- Then we go to Jason: forward edge Jason -> Brenda.\n\n- Then we go to Margaret: forward edge Margaret -> Jason.\n\n- Then we go to Wayne: forward edge Wayne -> Margaret.\n\n- Then we go to Zachary: forward edge Zachary -> Wayne.\n\n- Then we go to Harold: forward edge Harold -> Zachary.\n\n- Then we go to Christian: forward edge Christian -> Harold.\n\n- Then we go to Kayla: forward edge Kayla -> Christian.\n\n- Then we go to Thomas: forward edge Thomas -> Kayla.\n\n- Then we go to Richard: forward edge Richard -> Thomas.\n\n- Then we go to Kelly: forward edge Kelly -> Richard.\n\n- Then we go to George: forward edge George -> Kelly.\n\n- Then we go to Mark: forward edge Mark -> George.\n\n- Then we go to Julie: forward edge Julie -> Mark.\n\n- Then we go to Henry: forward edge Henry -> Julie.\n\n- Then we go to Joyce: forward edge Joyce -> Henry.\n\n- Then we go to Gary: forward edge Gary -> Joyce.\n\n- Then we go to Jacob: forward edge Jacob -> Gary.\n\n- Then we go to Brian: forward edge Brian -> Jacob.\n\n- Then we go to Victoria: forward edge Victoria -> Brian.\n\n- Then we go to Eric: forward edge Eric -> Victoria.\n\n- Then we go to Russell: forward edge Russell -> Eric.\n\n- Then we go to Rachel: forward edge Rachel -> Russell.\n\n- Then we go to Jack: forward edge Jack -> Rachel.\n\n- Then we go to Jeffrey: forward edge Jeffrey -> Jack.\n\n- Then we go to Evelyn: forward edge Evelyn -> Jeffrey.\n\n- Then we go to Teresa: forward edge Teresa -> Evelyn.\n\n- Then we go to Lawrence: forward edge Lawrence -> Teresa.\n\n- Then we go to Michelle: forward edge Michelle -> Lawrence.\n\n- Then we go to Joshua: forward edge Joshua -> Michelle.\n\n- Then we go to Kimberly: forward edge Kimberly -> Joshua.\n\n- Then we go to Gerald: forward edge Gerald -> Kimberly.\n\n- Then we go to Karen: forward edge Karen -> Gerald.\n\n- Then we go to Joe: forward edge Joe -> Karen.\n\n- Then we go to Keith: forward edge Keith -> Joe.\n\n- Then we go to Samuel: forward edge Samuel -> Keith.\n\n- Then we go to Paul: forward edge Paul -> Samuel.\n\n- Then we go to Carolyn: forward edge Carolyn -> Paul.\n\n- Then we go to Donald: forward edge Donald -> Carolyn.\n\n- Then we go to Bradley: forward edge Bradley -> Donald? Wait, we need to check the direction: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Donald is ancestor of Bradley, meaning edge Donald -> Bradley. So forward edge from Donald to Bradley. So moving from Donald to Bradley is forward direction. So the reverse step from Bradley to Donald is backward direction (i.e., we are moving opposite to the forward edge). So the step from Donald to Bradley is forward, but the reverse step from Bradley to Donald is moving opposite to the forward edge. However, we need to see if the chain we wrote includes \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" In the reverse traversal we wrote, we went from Donald to Bradley (i.e., from Donald to Bradley). That is forward direction. Wait, we need to re-evaluate the reverse chain.\n\nThe reverse chain we wrote earlier was:\n\nDonna -> Alexis -> Sara -> Natalie -> Ethan -> Danielle -> Lori -> Diane -> Jerry -> Shirley -> Albert -> Janice -> Abigail -> Raymond -> Bruce -> Katherine -> John -> Diana -> Julia -> Andrew -> Michael -> Barbara -> Ronald -> Brenda -> Jason -> Margaret -> Wayne -> Zachary -> Harold -> Christian -> Kayla -> Thomas -> Richard -> Kelly -> George -> Mark -> Julie -> Henry -> Joyce -> Gary -> Jacob -> Brian -> Victoria -> Eric -> Russell -> Rachel -> Jack -> Jeffrey -> Evelyn -> Teresa -> Lawrence -> Michelle -> Joshua -> Kimberly -> Gerald -> Karen -> Joe -> Keith -> Samuel -> Paul -> Carolyn -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene.\n\nNow, the direction of each arrow in this chain is reversed relative to the forward edges: For each step from X to Y, we have forward edge from Y to X. For example, from Donna to Alexis, forward edge is Alexis -> Donna. So moving from Donna to Alexis is reverse of forward edge. So the chain we wrote is a reverse traversal (i.e., moving against the direction of edges). So the chain is a path in the undirected graph (i.e., each pair is directly related). So the chain is not a directed path; it's a path that goes up and down relative to the directed edges.\n\nThus the ancestors of Donna are those nodes reachable via reverse traversal from Donna, but not necessarily all of them have a directed path to Donna; they only have a directed path to the previous node in the chain, which eventually leads to Donna. Actually, each node in the reverse chain does have a directed path to Donna: Because each step from X to Y in the reverse chain corresponds to a forward edge from Y to X. So the forward path from Y to Donna goes through X? Let's think: Suppose we have reverse chain Donna <- Alexis <- Sara <- ... <- Eugene. The forward edges are: Alexis -> Donna, Sara -> Alexis, ... , Eugene? Actually, we need to check the forward direction for the final step: Eugene -> ??? We have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So forward edge is Bradley -> Eugene. So the reverse step from Eugene to Bradley corresponds to forward edge Bradley -> Eugene. So the forward path from Bradley to Eugene goes to Eugene. But we need a forward path from Bradley to Donna: we need to see if there is a forward path from Bradley to Donna. Starting from Bradley, we have forward edge Bradley -> Eugene. That goes to Eugene, not to Donna. So Bradley does not have a forward path to Donna. So Bradley is not an ancestor of Donna in the directed sense. But the reverse chain includes Bradley because we reversed the direction of edges. However, the forward path from Bradley to Donna is not present; instead, we have a forward path from Bradley to Eugene, not to Donna. So Bradley is not an ancestor of Donna. So the ancestors of Donna are only those nodes that have a directed path to Donna. Let's compute the ancestors of Donna properly.\n\nWe have the directed edges list. Let's compute the ancestors of Donna by performing a reverse BFS (i.e., starting from Donna and moving backwards along incoming edges). Actually, the ancestors of Donna are those nodes from which there is a directed path to Donna (i.e., reachable in reverse direction). So we can compute ancestors by following incoming edges (reverse edges). Starting from Donna, we can go to its parents (incoming edges). We have only one incoming edge: Alexis -> Donna. So Alexis is a direct ancestor. Then from Alexis, we can go to its parents: Sara -> Alexis. So Sara is an ancestor. Then from Sara, its parents: Natalie -> Sara. So Natalie is ancestor. Continue: Ethan -> Natalie. So Ethan ancestor. Danielle -> Ethan. So Danielle ancestor. Lori -> Danielle. So Lori ancestor. Diane -> Lori. So Diane ancestor. Jerry -> Diane. So Jerry ancestor. Shirley -> Jerry. So Shirley ancestor. Albert -> Shirley. So Albert ancestor. Janice -> Albert. So Janice ancestor. Abigail -> Janice. So Abigail ancestor. Raymond -> Abigail. So Raymond ancestor. Bruce -> Raymond. So Bruce ancestor. Katherine -> Bruce. So Katherine ancestor. John -> Katherine. So John ancestor. Diana -> John. So Diana ancestor. Julia -> Diana. So Julia ancestor. Andrew -> Julia. So Andrew ancestor. Michael -> Andrew. So Michael ancestor. Barbara -> Michael. So Barbara ancestor. Ronald -> Barbara. So Ronald ancestor. Brenda -> Ronald. So Brenda ancestor. Jason -> Brenda. So Jason ancestor. Margaret -> Jason. So Margaret ancestor. Wayne -> Margaret. So Wayne ancestor. Zachary -> Wayne. So Zachary ancestor. Harold -> Zachary. So Harold ancestor. Christian -> Harold. So Christian ancestor. Kayla -> Christian. So Kayla ancestor. Thomas -> Kayla. So Thomas ancestor. Richard -> Thomas. So Richard ancestor. Kelly -> Richard. So Kelly ancestor. George -> Kelly. So George ancestor. Mark -> George. So Mark ancestor. Julie -> Mark. So Julie ancestor. Henry -> Julie. So Henry ancestor. Joyce -> Henry. So Joyce ancestor. Gary -> Joyce. So Gary ancestor. Jacob -> Gary. So Jacob ancestor. Brian -> Jacob. So Brian ancestor. Victoria -> Brian. So Victoria ancestor. Eric -> Victoria. So Eric ancestor. Russell -> Eric. So Russell ancestor. Rachel -> Russell. So Rachel ancestor. Jack -> Rachel. So Jack ancestor. Jeffrey -> Jack. So Jeffrey ancestor. Evelyn -> Jeffrey. So Evelyn ancestor. Teresa -> Evelyn. So Teresa ancestor. Lawrence -> Teresa. So Lawrence ancestor. Michelle -> Lawrence. So Michelle ancestor. Joshua -> Michelle. So Joshua ancestor. Kimberly -> Joshua. So Kimberly ancestor. Gerald -> Kimberly. So Gerald ancestor. Karen -> Gerald. So Karen ancestor. Joe -> Karen. So Joe ancestor. Keith -> Joe. So Keith ancestor. Samuel -> Keith. So Samuel ancestor. Paul -> Samuel. So Paul ancestor. Carolyn -> Paul. So Carolyn ancestor. Donald -> Carolyn. So Donald ancestor. Bradley -> Donald. So Bradley ancestor. Eugene? Wait, Bradley -> Donald is forward edge from Bradley to Donald. So the incoming edges to Bradley are from ??? Actually, we need to check the incoming edges to Bradley. The statement \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" means Donald -> Bradley (Donald is ancestor of Bradley). So the incoming edge to Bradley is from Donald. So Bradley's parent is Donald. So there is an incoming edge from Donald to Bradley. So the reverse traversal from Bradley goes to Donald (as we have). So Donald is ancestor of Bradley, and thus ancestor of Donna.\n\nNow, from Bradley, we need to check if there is any other incoming edge besides from Donald. Let's see: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" That's the only statement where Bradley appears as descendant. Also \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\"","reasoning_details":[{"id":"reasoning-text-1","format":"unknown","index":0,"type":"reasoning.text","text":"We need to parse the problem. We have a set of statements about lineage relationships (ancestor/descendant). The statements are in the form \"X is Y's descendant\" meaning X is a descendant of Y (so Y is an ancestor of X). Similarly, \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X is an ancestor of Y (Y is a descendant of X). The statements provide a directed graph of relationships: each statement gives an edge either from ancestor to descendant or descendant to ancestor.\n\nGoal: Determine the relationship between Donna and Eugene (specifically, is Donna a descendant of Eugene, ancestor of Eugene, share a common ancestor, share a common descendant, or none of the above). The answer is one of the options.\n\nWe need to interpret all statements and infer relationships. This is akin to constructing a partial order (ancestry).

Also maybe other statements about Donna? Let's search: No other statements mention Donna.\n\nEugene appears in: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley is ancestor of Eugene. Also maybe other statements about Eugene? Let's search: No other statements mention Eugene.\n\nThus we have:\n\n- Donna is descendant of Alexis (Donna <- Alexis).

We have a chain for Donna up to many ancestors. We have a chain for Eugene up to many ancestors. We need to see if they intersect (share a common ancestor) or if one is ancestor of the other.\n\nWe have:\n\nDonna chain: Donna is descendant of Alexis. So Alexis is ancestor of Donna. And we have chain: Alexis -> (parents? Possibly other ancestors).

So Bradley ancestor of Eugene.\n\nThus we have a huge chain linking all individuals.\n\nNow we need to see if Donna and Eugene are related via this chain.\n\nDonna chain ends at many ancestors, culminating in perhaps some root. Eugene chain ends at many ancestors, culminating in some root.\n\nWe need to see if they share a common ancestor or if one is ancestor of the other.\n\nGiven the chain includes many individuals, it's likely that they share a common ancestor somewhere up the chain. But we need to verify.\n\nFirst, we need to find the ancestors of Donna: we have a chain from Donna up to the \"top\" (maybe some individuals not linked to each other). Let's list all ancestors of Donna in order (descendant to ancestor direction). Starting from Donna, we have:\n\nDonna -> (ancestors) Alexis -> Sara -> Natalie -> Ethan -> Danielle -> Lori -> Diane -> Jerry -> Shirley -> Albert -> Janice -> Abigail -> Raymond -> Bruce -> Katherine -> John -> Diana -> Julia -> Andrew -> Michael -> Barbara -> Ronald -> Brenda -> Jason -> Margaret -> Wayne -> Zachary -> Harold -> Christian -> Kayla -> Thomas -> Richard -> Kelly -> George -> Mark -> Julie -> Henry -> Joyce -> Gary -> Jacob -> Brian -> Victoria -> Eric -> Russell -> Rachel -> Jack -> Jeffrey -> Evelyn -> Teresa -> Lawrence -> Michelle -> Joshua -> Kimberly -> Gerald -> Karen -> Joe -> Keith -> Samuel -> Paul -> Carolyn -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene -> ??? Possibly further ancestors beyond Eugene? Not given.\n\nThus Donna and Eugene are in the same chain? Let's examine: Does the chain we listed include Eugene? Yes, at the end, after Bradley, we have Eugene. So Donna's ancestors include Eugene? Wait, we need to verify: The chain we listed is from Donna up through many individuals to Eugene. But is Eugene indeed an ancestor of Donna? Let's see: We have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley is ancestor of Eugene. That means Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So Eugene is not ancestor of Bradley, but descendant. So the chain we listed from Donna to Eugene is from Donna to Eugene via many intermediate individuals, but the direction is: Donna -> ... -> Bradley -> Eugene? Actually we have \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Donald is ancestor of Bradley. So Donald is above Bradley. And \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley is above Eugene. So the chain is: ... -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene. So Eugene is a descendant of Bradley, which is descendant of Donald. So Eugene is below Bradley.\n\nThus Donna's chain includes Bradley and then Eugene. So indeed, Eugene is an ancestor of Donna? Wait, we need to be careful: The direction: \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" So Donna is descendant of Alexis. So Alexis is an ancestor of Donna. So the chain from Donna up to root goes through Alexis, then Sara, etc. The chain we listed goes upward: Donna -> Alexis -> Sara -> ... -> Eugene (since we listed many individuals). But we need to verify if Eugene appears in that chain. In the chain we listed, we have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley is above Eugene, not below. So if we go from Donna up to Eugene, we must go from Donna to Bradley (since Donna is descendant of Bradley) and then to Eugene (descendant of Bradley). But if we go upward from Donna, we go to ancestors, not to descendants. So if we go upward, we should not encounter Eugene, because Eugene is a descendant of Bradley, which is an ancestor of Donna. So Eugene is below Bradley, which is above Donna? Wait, let's think: We need to map the relationships correctly.\n\nWe need to decide the direction of edges. Usually, \"X is Y's descendant\" means X is younger (descendant) and Y is older (ancestor). So the relationship is Y -> X (Y is ancestor, X is descendant). So the edge direction from ancestor to descendant is Y -> X. In graph terms, we have directed edges from ancestor to descendant.\n\nThus \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" means edge Alexis -> Donna.\n\n\"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" means edge Bradley -> Eugene.\n\nThus the chain from Donna up to ancestors goes in reverse direction: we can go from Donna to Alexis (since Alexis -> Donna). Actually, from Donna we can go backwards (i.e., following edges from descendant to ancestor) to its ancestors by reversing direction: Donna's ancestors are those from which there is a path to Donna. So we need to consider the graph directed from ancestor to descendant. So from Donna, we can go upstream (reverse edges) to Alexis, then from Alexis upstream to Sara, etc. But we need to check if there is a path from some ancestor to Donna that goes through all those individuals. Actually, we need to consider the transitive closure.\n\nNow we have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So edge Bradley -> Eugene. So Bradley is ancestor of Eugene. So Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So if we go upstream from Eugene (reverse edges), we go to Bradley, then to Donald, etc. So Eugene's ancestors are Bradley, Donald, etc. So we need to see if there is any overlap between Donna's ancestors and Eugene's ancestors, or if one is ancestor of the other.\n\nThe chain we listed earlier seems to be a path from Donna up to Eugene (i.e., from Donna to some ancestor chain that includes Eugene as a descendant). But that path includes Eugene as a descendant of some earlier ancestor. Let's examine the path we wrote:\n\nDonna -> Alexis -> Sara -> Natalie -> Ethan -> Danielle -> Lori -> Diane -> Jerry -> Shirley -> Albert -> Janice -> Abigail -> Raymond -> Bruce -> Katherine -> John -> Diana -> Julia -> Andrew -> Michael -> Barbara -> Ronald -> Brenda -> Jason -> Margaret -> Wayne -> Zachary -> Harold -> Christian -> Kayla -> Thomas -> Richard -> Kelly -> George -> Mark -> Julie -> Henry -> Joyce -> Gary -> Jacob -> Brian -> Victoria -> Eric -> Russell -> Rachel -> Jack -> Jeffrey -> Evelyn -> Teresa -> Lawrence -> Michelle -> Joshua -> Kimberly -> Gerald -> Karen -> Joe -> Keith -> Samuel -> Paul -> Carolyn -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene\n\nThis is a path where each step is \"X is Y's descendant\" (i.e., Y is ancestor of X). Actually, the direction is: Y -> X. So if we go from Donna to Alexis, that is \"Alexis is ancestor of Donna\". So \"Donna is Alexis's descendant\" is correct. Then from Alexis to Sara: \"Sara is Alexis's ancestor\". So that is \"Sara is ancestor of Alexis\", which means \"Alexis is descendant of Sara\". So from Alexis to Sara we have \"Alexis is descendant of Sara\". So that is consistent: \"Alexis is descendant of Sara\". So the path we listed is a chain of ancestor-descendant relationships where each step is either \"X is Y's descendant\" or \"Y is X's ancestor\". So each step is a direct relationship given in the statements.\n\nThus the chain we listed is indeed a valid chain of relationships connecting Donna to Eugene via a sequence of direct statements. However, we need to verify that each step in the chain is supported by a given statement. Let's check each step:\n\n- Donna -> Alexis: \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Alexis -> Sara: \"Sara is Alexis's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Sara -> Natalie: \"Natalie is Sara's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Natalie -> Ethan: \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Ethan -> Danielle: \"Ethan is Danielle's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Danielle -> Lori: \"Danielle is Lori's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Lori -> Diane: \"Diane is Lori's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Diane -> Jerry: \"Jerry is Diane's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Jerry -> Shirley: \"Shirley is Jerry's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Shirley -> Albert: \"Shirley is Albert's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Albert -> Janice: \"Janice is Albert's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Janice -> Abigail: \"Janice is Abigail's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Abigail -> Raymond: \"Raymond is Abigail's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Raymond -> Bruce: \"Bruce is Raymond's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Bruce -> Katherine: \"Bruce is Katherine's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Katherine -> John: \"Katherine is John's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- John -> Diana: \"Diana is John's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Diana -> Julia: \"Julia is Diana's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Julia -> Andrew: \"Julia is Andrew's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Andrew -> Michael: \"Michael is Andrew's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Michael -> Barbara: \"Michael is Barbara's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Barbara -> Ronald: \"Ronald is Barbara's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Ronald -> Brenda: \"Brenda is Ronald's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Brenda -> Jason: \"Brenda is Jason's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Jason -> Margaret: \"Jason is Margaret's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Margaret -> Wayne: \"Margaret is Wayne's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Wayne -> Zachary: \"Zachary is Wayne's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Zachary -> Harold: \"Zachary is Harold's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Harold -> Christian: \"Harold is Christian's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Christian -> Kayla: \"Christian is Kayla's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Kayla -> Thomas: \"Kayla is Thomas's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Thomas -> Richard: \"Thomas is Richard's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Richard -> Kelly: \"Kelly is Richard's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Kelly -> George: \"Kelly is George's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- George -> Mark: \"George is Mark's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Mark -> Julie: \"Julie is Mark's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Julie -> Henry: \"Julie is Henry's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Henry -> Joyce: \"Joyce is Henry's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Joyce -> Gary: \"Gary is Joyce's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Gary -> Jacob: \"Gary is Jacob's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Jacob -> Brian: \"Jacob is Brian's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Brian -> Victoria: \"Brian is Victoria's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Victoria -> Eric: \"Eric is Victoria's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Eric -> Russell: \"Russell is Eric's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Russell -> Rachel: \"Rachel is Russell's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Rachel -> Jack: \"Rachel is Jack's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Jack -> Jeffrey: \"Jeffrey is Jack's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Jeffrey -> Evelyn: \"Jeffrey is Evelyn's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Evelyn -> Teresa: \"Teresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Teresa -> Lawrence: \"Lawrence is Teresa's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Lawrence -> Michelle: \"Lawrence is Michelle's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Michelle -> Joshua: \"Michelle is Joshua's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Joshua -> Kimberly: \"Joshua is Kimberly's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Kimberly -> Gerald: \"Kimberly is Gerald's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Gerald -> Karen: \"Gerald is Karen's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Karen -> Joe: \"Joe is Karen's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Joe -> Keith: \"Keith is Joe's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Keith -> Samuel: \"Keith is Samuel's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Samuel -> Paul: \"Samuel is Paul's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Paul -> Carolyn: \"Paul is Carolyn's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Carolyn -> Donald: \"Donald is Carolyn's descendant.\" Yes.\n\n- Donald -> Bradley: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\n- Bradley -> Eugene: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" Yes.\n\nThus we have a chain connecting Donna to Eugene via these relationships. The chain goes from Donna up through ancestors and then down to Eugene? Actually, the chain alternates direction: at each step, the relationship is either \"X is Y's descendant\" or \"Y is X's ancestor\". In the chain, we have direction changes. For example, from Donna to Alexis: Donna is descendant of Alexis (so Alexis is ancestor). Then Alexis to Sara: Sara is ancestor of Alexis (so Sara is higher). So the chain goes upward (to older generations) as we go from Donna to Sara to Natalie to Ethan etc. However, at some points, the direction flips: e.g., from Ethan to Danielle: Ethan is descendant of Danielle, so we go downwards (to younger generation). So the chain is not monotonic in age; it's just a path through the graph. The graph may have cycles? Possibly there are cycles (like some persons may be both ancestors and descendants of each other indirectly). But we need to find the relationship between Donna and Eugene: Are they directly connected via ancestry? The path we found suggests that there is a path from Donna to Eugene via these relationships. However, the question is about lineage relationship: \"Donna is Eugene's descendant\" or \"Donna is Eugene's ancestor\" or they share a common ancestor, or share a common descendant, or none of the above.\n\nGiven that we have a path from Donna to Eugene, but does that path reflect a direct ancestor-descendant relationship? Let's examine the path direction: Starting from Donna, we go to Alexis (Donna descendant of Alexis). Then to Sara (Alexis descendant of Sara). So at this point, we have moved upward to Sara (older). Then to Natalie (Sara descendant of Natalie). Then to Ethan (Natalie descendant of Ethan). Actually, \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor\" means Ethan is ancestor of Natalie, so Natalie is descendant of Ethan. So we moved downward to Ethan (younger). Then to Danielle (Ethan descendant of Danielle). So we moved upward to Danielle? Wait, \"Ethan is Danielle's descendant\" means Ethan is descendant of Danielle, so Danielle is ancestor of Ethan. So we moved upward to Danielle (older). Then to Lori (Danielle descendant of Lori) meaning Danielle is descendant of Lori, so we moved upward to Lori (older). Then to Diane (Lori descendant of Diane) means Diane is ancestor of Lori, so we moved upward to Diane (older).

Then to Kelly (Richard descendant of Kelly) meaning Kelly is ancestor of Richard, so we moved upward to Kelly (older). Then to George (Kelly descendant of George) meaning George is ancestor of Kelly, so we moved upward to George (older). Then to Mark (George descendant of Mark) meaning Mark is ancestor of George, so we moved upward to Mark (older). Then to Julie (Mark descendant of Julie) meaning Julie is ancestor of Mark, so we moved upward to Julie (older). Then to Henry (Julie descendant of Henry) meaning Henry is ancestor of Julie, so we moved upward to Henry (older).

Then to Bradley (Donald descendant of Bradley) meaning Bradley is ancestor of Donald, so we moved upward to Bradley (older). Then to Eugene (Bradley descendant of Eugene) meaning Eugene is ancestor of Bradley, so we moved upward to Eugene (older). So we see that the chain goes upward (older) each step, except some steps where we go downward (younger) (like from Ethan to Danielle, from Katherine to John? Actually, we need to check each step: The pattern is consistent: each step goes upward to the ancestor of the previous person. But sometimes the direction flips? Let's examine each step more carefully:\n\n- Start: Donna (descendant of Alexis). So Alexis is ancestor of Donna. So moving from Donna to Alexis is moving up.\n\n- Alexis is descendant of Sara. So moving from Alexis to Sara is moving up.\n\n- Sara is descendant of Natalie. So moving from Sara to Natalie is moving up.\n\n- Natalie is ancestor of Ethan? Actually \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor.\" So Ethan is ancestor of Natalie. So moving from Natalie to Ethan is moving down (since Natalie is descendant of Ethan). Wait, \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor\" means Ethan is older than Natalie. So Natalie is descendant of Ethan. So moving from Natalie to Ethan goes up to an older generation. So it's still moving up (to ancestor). Actually, earlier we said \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor\" means Ethan is ancestor of Natalie, so Natalie is descendant of Ethan. So moving from Natalie to Ethan goes up (to ancestor). So consistent.\n\n- Ethan is descendant of Danielle. So moving from Ethan to Danielle is moving up (to ancestor). Wait, \"Ethan is Danielle's descendant\" means Ethan is younger, Danielle is older. So moving from Ethan to Danielle goes up.\n\n- Danielle is descendant of Lori.

So moving from Margaret to Wayne goes up.\n\n- Wayne is descendant of Zachary. So moving from Wayne to Zachary goes up.\n\n- Zachary is descendant of Harold. So moving from Zachary to Harold goes up.\n\n- Harold is descendant of Christian. So moving from Harold to Christian goes up.\n\n- Christian is descendant of Kayla. So moving from Christian to Kayla goes up.\n\n- Kayla is descendant of Thomas. So moving from Kayla to Thomas goes up.\n\n- Thomas is descendant of Richard. So moving from Thomas to Richard goes up.\n\n- Richard is descendant of Kelly. So moving from Richard to Kelly goes up.\n\n- Kelly is descendant of George. So moving from Kelly to George goes up.\n\n- George is descendant of Mark. So moving from George to Mark goes up.\n\n- Mark is descendant of Julie. So moving from Mark to Julie goes up.\n\n- Julie is descendant of Henry. So moving from Julie to Henry goes up.\n\n- Henry is descendant of Joyce. So moving from Henry to Joyce goes up.\n\n- Joyce is descendant of Gary. So moving from Joyce to Gary goes up.\n\n- Gary is descendant of Jacob. So moving from Gary to Jacob goes up.\n\n- Jacob is descendant of Brian. So moving from Jacob to Brian goes up.\n\n- Brian is descendant of Victoria. So moving from Brian to Victoria goes up.\n\n- Victoria is descendant of Eric. So moving from Victoria to Eric goes up.\n\n- Eric is descendant of Russell. So moving from Eric to Russell goes up.\n\n- Russell is descendant of Rachel. So moving from Russell to Rachel goes up.\n\n- Rachel is descendant of Jack.

So moving from Jeffrey to Evelyn goes up.\n\n- Evelyn is descendant of Teresa. So moving from Evelyn to Teresa goes up.\n\n- Teresa is descendant of Lawrence. So moving from Teresa to Lawrence goes up.\n\n- Lawrence is descendant of Michelle. So moving from Lawrence to Michelle goes up.\n\n- Michelle is descendant of Joshua. So moving from Michelle to Joshua goes up.\n\n- Joshua is descendant of Kimberly. So moving from Joshua to Kimberly goes up.\n\n- Kimberly is descendant of Gerald. So moving from Kimberly to Gerald goes up.\n\n- Gerald is descendant of Karen. So moving from Gerald to Karen goes up.\n\n- Karen is descendant of Joe. So moving from Karen to Joe goes up.\n\n- Joe is descendant of Keith. So moving from Joe to Keith goes up.\n\n- Keith is descendant of Samuel. So moving from Keith to Samuel goes up.\n\n- Samuel is descendant of Paul. So moving from Samuel to Paul goes up.\n\n- Paul is descendant of Carolyn. So moving from Paul to Carolyn goes up.\n\n- Carolyn is descendant of Donald. So moving from Carolyn to Donald goes up.\n\n- Donald is descendant of Bradley. So moving from Donald to Bradley goes up.\n\n- Bradley is descendant of Eugene. So moving from Bradley to Eugene goes up.\n\nThus the entire chain is a monotonic upward path from Donna to Eugene, each step moving to an ancestor. So indeed, Eugene is an ancestor of Donna? Wait, we need to be careful: In the chain, we move from Donna to Alexis (ancestor), then to Sara (ancestor), etc., eventually to Eugene (ancestor). So each step moves upward to older individuals. So the final node Eugene is older than the previous node (Bradley). So Eugene is older than Bradley, which is older than Donald, etc., all the way up to Donna. So Eugene is an ancestor of Donna. But we need to verify the direction: The statements are \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" That means Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, i.e., Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So if we go from Bradley to Eugene, we go downwards (to younger). However, in our chain we went from Bradley to Eugene as moving upward (from descendant to ancestor). That seems contradictory. Let's examine: The statement \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" means Bradley is an ancestor of Eugene. In terms of directed edges from ancestor to descendant, we have edge Bradley -> Eugene. So if we move from Bradley to Eugene, we are moving downwards (to descendant). But in our chain we moved from Bradley to Eugene as part of moving upward from Donna to Eugene. However, in the chain we wrote earlier, we said \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So moving from Bradley to Eugene goes downwards. But we are moving from Donna up to Eugene via intermediate steps. Let's see the direction: Starting from Donna, we go up to Alexis, then to Sara, etc., eventually to Bradley, then to Eugene. Actually, we need to check the direction of each step in the chain relative to the edge direction.\n\nIf we have edge X -> Y (X ancestor of Y). Then moving from Y to X is moving upwards (to ancestor). So if we have edge Bradley -> Eugene, then moving from Eugene to Bradley is moving up to ancestor. But we are moving from Bradley to Eugene in the chain (i.e., we go from Bradley to Eugene). That would be moving downwards (to descendant). However, earlier we said the chain is monotonic upward from Donna to Eugene. That seems contradictory. Let's examine the chain again: The chain we wrote: Donna -> Alexis -> Sara -> Natalie -> Ethan -> Danielle -> Lori -> Diane -> Jerry -> Shirley -> Albert -> Janice -> Abigail -> Raymond -> Bruce -> Katherine -> John -> Diana -> Julia -> Andrew -> Michael -> Barbara -> Ronald -> Brenda -> Jason -> Margaret -> Wayne -> Zachary -> Harold -> Christian -> Kayla -> Thomas -> Richard -> Kelly -> George -> Mark -> Julie -> Henry -> Joyce -> Gary -> Jacob -> Brian -> Victoria -> Eric -> Russell -> Rachel -> Jack -> Jeffrey -> Evelyn -> Teresa -> Lawrence -> Michelle -> Joshua -> Kimberly -> Gerald -> Karen -> Joe -> Keith -> Samuel -> Paul -> Carolyn -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene.\n\nWe need to check each step's direction relative to the edge direction. For each step we need to verify that there is a direct relationship (either X is Y's descendant or Y is X's ancestor). The chain alternates between \"X is Y's descendant\" and \"Y is X's ancestor\" statements. The direction of the relationship (who is ancestor of who) changes each step.\n\nSpecifically, the statements are of two types:\n\n- \"X is Y's descendant.\" => X descendant of Y => Y ancestor of X => edge Y -> X.\n\n- \"X is Y's ancestor.\" => X ancestor of Y => edge X -> Y.\n\nThus the chain we wrote includes both types.\n\nNow, for each step, we need to check that the statement matches the direction of the edge relative to the chain order. Let's re-evaluate each step:\n\nStep 1: Donna -> Alexis: \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" This matches the pattern: X (Donna) is Y's descendant => Y (Alexis) is ancestor of X (Donna). So the edge is Alexis -> Donna. In the chain order, we go from Donna (descendant) to Alexis (ancestor). So we go from descendant to ancestor (upwards). That's consistent.\n\nStep 2: Alexis -> Sara: \"Sara is Alexis's ancestor.\" This matches: X (Sara) is Y's ancestor => X (Sara) ancestor of Y (Alexis). Edge: Sara -> Alexis. In the chain order, we go from Alexis (descendant) to Sara (ancestor). So we go from descendant to ancestor (upwards). Good.\n\nStep 3: Sara -> Natalie: \"Natalie is Sara's ancestor.\" => Natalie ancestor of Sara => edge Natalie -> Sara. In chain order, we go from Sara (descendant) to Natalie (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 4: Natalie -> Ethan: \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor.\" => Ethan ancestor of Natalie => edge Ethan -> Natalie. Chain: from Natalie (descendant) to Ethan (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 5: Ethan -> Danielle: \"Ethan is Danielle's descendant.\" => X (Ethan) is Y's descendant => Y (Danielle) is ancestor of X (Ethan). So edge Danielle -> Ethan. Chain: from Ethan (descendant) to Danielle (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 6: Danielle -> Lori: \"Danielle is Lori's descendant.\" => Danielle descendant of Lori => edge Lori -> Danielle. Chain: from Danielle (descendant) to Lori (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 7: Lori -> Diane: \"Diane is Lori's ancestor.\" => Diane ancestor of Lori => edge Diane -> Lori.

Chain: from Keith (descendant) to Samuel (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 59: Samuel -> Paul: \"Samuel is Paul's ancestor.\" => Samuel ancestor of Paul => edge Samuel -> Paul. Chain: from Samuel (descendant) to Paul (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 60: Paul -> Carolyn: \"Paul is Carolyn's ancestor.\" => Paul ancestor of Carolyn => edge Paul -> Carolyn. Chain: from Paul (descendant) to Carolyn (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 61: Carolyn -> Donald: \"Donald is Carolyn's descendant.\" => Donald descendant of Carolyn => edge Carolyn -> Donald. Chain: from Carolyn (descendant) to Donald (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 62: Donald -> Bradley: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" => Donald ancestor of Bradley => edge Donald -> Bradley. Chain: from Donald (descendant) to Bradley (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nStep 63: Bradley -> Eugene: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" => Bradley ancestor of Eugene => edge Bradley -> Eugene. Chain: from Bradley (descendant) to Eugene (ancestor). Upwards.\n\nThus indeed, each step in the chain moves upward (to an ancestor). So the chain goes from Donna up to Eugene, meaning Eugene is an ancestor of Donna (since we moved upward to Eugene). However, we need to verify that \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor\" means Bradley is older than Eugene, so moving from Bradley to Eugene is moving downwards (to descendant). But we moved from Bradley to Eugene as upward step, which seems contradictory. Let's examine the meaning: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" This statement says Bradley is ancestor of Eugene. In terms of directed edge, we have Bradley -> Eugene (ancestor to descendant). So moving from Bradley to Eugene moves downwards (to younger). However, in our chain, we moved from Donna to Bradley (upwards). Then from Bradley to Eugene (downwards). But earlier we said the chain moves upward each step, but that may be inaccurate for the final step. Let's check the direction of the final step relative to the chain order.\n\nWe have chain: ... -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene.\n\nWe have statements:\n\n- Donald is Bradley's ancestor. (Donald ancestor of Bradley). So edge Donald -> Bradley. So moving from Donald to Bradley is moving downwards (to descendant). But earlier we said moving from Donald (descendant) to Bradley (ancestor) is upward. Actually, we need to see the pattern: The chain we wrote is Donna -> ... -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene. In our chain, we moved from Donna to Alexis (upward), then to Sara (upward), etc., all the way to Donald (which we consider descendant of Bradley). But the direction for each step is based on the statement type. Let's verify the direction of the step from Donald to Bradley.\n\nStatement: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" This says Donald is ancestor of Bradley. So Donald is older than Bradley. So moving from Donald to Bradley is moving downwards (to younger). However, in the chain we wrote, we treat Donald as descendant of Bradley? Let's re-evaluate.\n\nWe need to understand the chain direction precisely. The chain we wrote is a sequence of individuals where each adjacent pair is related by a direct statement. The direction of the relationship can be either \"X is Y's descendant\" or \"Y is X's ancestor\". In each case, the relationship direction is fixed: if we have \"X is Y's descendant\", then Y is ancestor of X. If we have \"Y is X's ancestor\", then Y is ancestor of X. So in both cases, the ancestor is the one that appears first in the statement after \"X is Y's descendant\" (the \"Y\") and after \"Y is X's ancestor\" (the \"Y\").\n\nThus for each step we can identify the ancestor (the older person) and descendant (the younger person). The chain we wrote goes from a descendant to an ancestor (i.e., from younger to older). So each step moves upward (to older). But we need to check if each step indeed moves upward. Let's verify each step's orientation:\n\n- Step 1: \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" The ancestor is Alexis, descendant is Donna. So moving from Donna to Alexis moves upward.\n\n- Step 2: \"Sara is Alexis's ancestor.\" Ancestor is Sara, descendant is Alexis. So moving from Alexis to Sara moves upward.\n\n- Step 3: \"Natalie is Sara's ancestor.\" Ancestor Natalie, descendant Sara. So moving from Sara to Natalie upward.\n\n- Step 4: \"Ethan is Natalie's ancestor.\" Ancestor Ethan, descendant Natalie.

So moving from Joshua to Kimberly upward.\n\n- Step 54: \"Kimberly is Gerald's ancestor.\" Ancestor Kimberly, descendant Gerald. So moving from Kimberly to Gerald upward.\n\n- Step 55: \"Gerald is Karen's ancestor.\" Ancestor Gerald, descendant Karen. So moving from Gerald to Karen upward.\n\n- Step 56: \"Joe is Karen's descendant.\" Ancestor Karen, descendant Joe. So moving from Karen to Joe upward.\n\n- Step 57: \"Keith is Joe's descendant.\" Ancestor Joe, descendant Keith. So moving from Joe to Keith upward.\n\n- Step 58: \"Keith is Samuel's ancestor.\" Ancestor Keith, descendant Samuel. So moving from Keith to Samuel upward.\n\n- Step 59: \"Samuel is Paul's ancestor.\" Ancestor Samuel, descendant Paul. So moving from Samuel to Paul upward.\n\n- Step 60: \"Paul is Carolyn's ancestor.\" Ancestor Paul, descendant Carolyn. So moving from Paul to Carolyn upward.\n\n- Step 61: \"Donald is Carolyn's descendant.\" Ancestor Carolyn, descendant Donald. So moving from Carolyn to Donald upward.\n\n- Step 62: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" Ancestor Donald, descendant Bradley. So moving from Donald to Bradley upward.\n\n- Step 63: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" Ancestor Bradley, descendant Eugene. So moving from Bradley to Eugene upward.\n\nThus indeed, each step moves upward (to older). So the chain is monotonic upward. That means Eugene is older (ancestor) than Bradley, which is older than Donald, etc., all the way to Donna. So Eugene is an ancestor of Donna.\n\nThus the relationship between Donna and Eugene is: Donna is a descendant of Eugene (i.e., Eugene is an ancestor of Donna). But we need to confirm that Eugene is indeed an ancestor of Donna (i.e., there is a path from Eugene to Donna following ancestor-to-descendant edges). Let's check the path from Eugene downwards (i.e., from ancestor to descendant) to Donna. Starting from Eugene, we have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" Wait, that says Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, not descendant. So Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So moving from Eugene to Bradley is moving downwards (to older?). Actually, moving from Eugene to Bradley moves to an ancestor (older). So if we want to go from Eugene to Donna following ancestor-to-descendant edges, we need to go from Eugene up to its ancestors (Bradley, Donald, etc.) and then eventually to Donna? Wait, we need to consider the direction of the edges.\n\nWe have edges from ancestor to descendant. For each statement \"X is Y's ancestor\", we have edge X -> Y. For each statement \"X is Y's descendant\", we have edge Y -> X. So the edges are oriented from ancestor to descendant.\n\nThus the graph is directed from older to younger. The chain we wrote goes from Donna (descendant) up to Eugene (ancestor). That is moving opposite direction of edges (i.e., from descendant to ancestor). So the chain is a path in the reverse direction of edges. So the path from Eugene to Donna is the reverse of that chain, which follows edges in the forward direction (ancestor to descendant). So we need to reverse the chain to get a path from Eugene to Donna (ancestor to descendant). Let's reverse the chain:\n\nEugene -> Bradley -> Donald -> Carolyn -> Paul -> Samuel -> Keith -> Joe -> Karen -> Gerald -> Kimberly -> Joshua -> Michelle -> Lawrence -> Teresa -> Evelyn -> Jeffrey -> Jack -> Rachel -> Russell -> Eric -> Victoria -> Brian -> Jacob -> Gary -> Joyce -> Henry -> Julie -> Mark -> George -> Kelly -> Richard -> Thomas -> Kayla -> Christian -> Harold -> Zachary -> Wayne -> Margaret -> Jason -> Brenda -> Ronald -> Barbara -> Michael -> Andrew -> Julia -> Diana -> John -> Katherine -> Bruce -> Raymond -> Abigail -> Janice -> Albert -> Shirley -> Jerry -> Diane -> Lori -> Danielle -> Ethan -> Natalie -> Sara -> Alexis -> Donna.\n\nNow we need to verify each reversed step corresponds to an edge from ancestor to descendant (i.e., a forward direction in the graph). Let's verify each reversed step:\n\n- Eugene -> Bradley: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" Means Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, so edge Bradley -> Eugene. So moving from Eugene to Bradley is moving opposite direction (from descendant to ancestor). Actually, we need to check: If we reverse the chain, we go from Eugene to Bradley. In the graph, edge is Bradley -> Eugene (ancestor to descendant). So moving from Eugene to Bradley is moving opposite direction (descendant to ancestor). But we want to go from ancestor to descendant. So maybe we need to reverse the chain differently.\n\nHold on. Let's be systematic. The chain we wrote is a sequence of relationships such that each adjacent pair is directly related by a statement. But the direction of the relationship (who is ancestor of who) alternates. The chain we wrote is a path where each step is a direct relationship (i.e., either \"X is Y's descendant\" or \"Y is X's ancestor\"). The direction of the relationship is always from the older to the younger (ancestor to descendant). However, the chain we wrote goes from younger to older each step. So the chain is reversed relative to the directed edges. So each step is a reverse edge.\n\nThus the chain is a path in the reverse direction of the directed graph. So the reverse of the chain is a path in the forward direction (ancestor to descendant). So we can invert the chain to get a path from Eugene (the oldest) to Donna (the youngest). However, we need to check if the reversed chain indeed matches the directed edges.\n\nLet's reverse the chain and see if each reversed step corresponds to a direct statement that says the first person is an ancestor of the second (i.e., edge from first to second). The reversed chain would be:\n\nEugene <- Bradley <- Donald <- Carolyn <- Paul <- Samuel <- Keith <- Joe <- Karen <- Gerald <- Kimberly <- Joshua <- Michelle <- Lawrence <- Teresa <- Evelyn <- Jeffrey <- Jack <- Rachel <- Russell <- Eric <- Victoria <- Brian <- Jacob <- Gary <- Joyce <- Henry <- Julie <- Mark <- George <- Kelly <- Richard <- Thomas <- Kayla <- Christian <- Harold <- Zachary <- Wayne <- Margaret <- Jason <- Brenda <- Ronald <- Barbara <- Michael <- Andrew <- Julia <- Diana <- John <- Katherine <- Bruce <- Raymond <- Abigail <- Janice <- Albert <- Shirley <- Jerry <- Diane <- Lori <- Danielle <- Ethan <- Natalie <- Sara <- Alexis <- Donna.\n\nBut we need to check if each of these reversed steps is a direct statement that matches the pattern \"X is Y's ancestor\". For example, \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" This is \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So in the reversed chain, we have Eugene (descendant) to Bradley (ancestor). That is not a direct statement of \"X is Y's ancestor\" with X being the first (Eugene) and Y being the second (Bradley). The direct statement is \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So the direction is from Bradley (ancestor) to Eugene (descendant). In the reversed chain, we have Eugene -> Bradley. So that's the opposite direction. So the reversed chain does not correspond to a direct statement in the forward direction.\n\nThus the chain we wrote is not a directed path from ancestor to descendant, but a chain of alternating statements that go from descendant to ancestor each step. That means the chain is a path in the undirected sense, but not necessarily a directed path.\n\nThus we need to determine the relationship between Donna and Eugene based on the given statements, not necessarily that there is a directed path from one to the other. The possible relationships are:\n\n- Donna is Eugene's descendant (i.e., there exists a directed path from Eugene to Donna following ancestor-to-descendant edges). This would require that there is a chain where each step is of the form \"X is Y's ancestor\" (i.e., X ancestor of Y) such that we can go from Eugene to Donna. Or equivalently, there is a chain of statements that connect Eugene to Donna where each statement is of the form \"X is Y's ancestor\" (or \"Y is X's descendant\").\n\n- Donna is Eugene's ancestor (i.e., there is a directed path from Donna to Eugene following ancestor-to-descendant edges). This would require statements that say Donna is ancestor of Eugene, or Donna is ancestor of some intermediate, etc.\n\n- They share a common ancestor (i.e., there exists some person X such that X is an ancestor of both Donna and Eugene). This is a weaker condition: there exists a node that is an ancestor of both.\n\n- They share a common descendant (i.e., there exists a node that is a descendant of both Donna and Eugene). This is also possible.\n\n- None of the above (i.e., they are unrelated in all these senses).\n\nWe need to determine which is correct.\n\nGiven the huge chain connecting them, it seems they share a common ancestor (maybe many). But we need to verify if they share a common ancestor. The chain we found seems to be a path connecting Donna and Eugene via many intermediate relationships. That suggests they are in the same lineage tree, thus they share a common ancestor (some root). However, the chain includes both ancestors and descendants, but the fact that there is a path connecting them suggests they are in the same connected component of the graph. However, we need to be careful: The graph is directed (ancestor->descendant). If we treat it as an undirected graph, there is a path connecting Donna and Eugene. But for \"share a common ancestor\" we need a node that is an ancestor of both Donna and Eugene (i.e., there is a directed path from that node to Donna and also from that node to Eugene). Since the graph is directed, a common ancestor would be a node from which there are directed paths to both Donna and Eugene. Does such a node exist? Possibly many.\n\nGiven the chain we found includes many nodes, but many of those nodes are ancestors of both? Let's examine the chain we wrote: Starting from Donna, we go to Alexis (ancestor), then to Sara (ancestor), etc., eventually to Eugene (ancestor). So the chain is a path of ancestors linking Donna to Eugene. That means that all intermediate nodes are ancestors of Donna (since we moved upward). Also, all intermediate nodes are ancestors of Eugene? Actually, moving upward from Donna to Eugene means we are moving to older persons. So the nodes we encounter are ancestors of Donna, and also ancestors of Eugene? Not necessarily. For a node to be an ancestor of Eugene, we need to have a directed path from that node to Eugene (ancestor->descendant). In the chain we have nodes that are ancestors of Donna but not necessarily ancestors of Eugene. However, we need to examine the graph's direction for each node relative to Eugene.\n\nLet's consider the chain: Starting at Donna (descendant of Alexis). So Alexis is ancestor of Donna. Next we have Alexis (descendant of Sara). So Sara is ancestor of Alexis, and thus also ancestor of Donna (by transitivity). So Sara is ancestor of Donna.

Continue: Eugene is ancestor of Bradley, thus also ancestor of Donna.\n\nThus indeed, every node in the chain is an ancestor of Donna, and Eugene is the final ancestor. So Eugene is an ancestor of Donna. Therefore, Donna is Eugene's descendant. So answer 1: \"Donna is Eugene's descendant.\"\n\nBut we need to verify that the direction of the final edge (Bradley -> Eugene) is correct. Actually, we need to check \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley is ancestor of Eugene. So moving from Bradley to Eugene is moving downwards (to descendant). So Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So Eugene is a descendant of Bradley. So if Bradley is an ancestor of Donna, then Eugene is also an ancestor of Donna? Wait, if Bradley is ancestor of Donna, then Eugene is descendant of Bradley, so Eugene is younger than Bradley. So Eugene might be a descendant of Bradley, which is an ancestor of Donna. So Eugene could be a descendant of an ancestor of Donna, which does not guarantee Eugene is an ancestor of Donna. In fact, if Eugene is descendant of an ancestor of Donna, then Eugene could be either an ancestor of Donna (if Eugene is also ancestor of Donna) or a descendant of an ancestor but not necessarily an ancestor of Donna. Let's examine the chain more carefully.\n\nThe chain we wrote is a series of relationships where each step moves from a descendant to an ancestor (i.e., we are moving upward). The final step is from Bradley (descendant) to Eugene (ancestor). So Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley? Wait, the statement \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor\" says Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, meaning Bradley is older than Eugene. So moving from Bradley (descendant) to Eugene (ancestor) would be moving upward (from descendant to ancestor). But that contradicts the statement: If Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, then Eugene is descendant of Bradley. So moving from Bradley to Eugene is moving downwards (to descendant). However, in our chain, we treat \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor\" as the step from Bradley to Eugene, moving upward. But the statement says Bradley is ancestor of Eugene, so moving from Bradley to Eugene is moving downwards. So we need to correct our interpretation.\n\nLet's re-express the chain step by step with proper orientation:\n\nWe need to find a chain connecting Donna and Eugene where each adjacent pair is directly related by a statement. The chain can be oriented either way; we just need a path. The chain we wrote is a valid path (undirected). However, the direction of each relationship is not necessarily consistent with moving from Donna to Eugene; it's just a series of statements linking them.\n\nThus we need to check if there is a directed path from Eugene to Donna (i.e., Eugene is ancestor of Donna) or from Donna to Eugene (Donna is ancestor of Eugene). The chain we found is not directed, but we can check if any directed path exists.\n\nGiven the statements, we can try to see if there is a directed path from Eugene to Donna. For that, we need to follow edges from ancestor to descendant. Let's try to trace from Eugene.\n\nWe have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So edge: Bradley -> Eugene (Bradley ancestor of Eugene). So from Eugene, we cannot go to Bradley (since edge is from Bradley to Eugene). So Eugene is descendant of Bradley, not ancestor. So from Eugene, there is no outgoing edge to Bradley (since edge is incoming). So we cannot go from Eugene to Bradley following ancestor-to-descendant direction. So there is no directed path from Eugene to Bradley. So Eugene cannot be ancestor of Donna, because the chain from Eugene would go nowhere. However, maybe there is a different path from Eugene to Donna via some other edges. Let's examine all statements involving Eugene: Only \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Eugene appears only in that statement. So Eugene has no outgoing edges (i.e., no statements where Eugene is ancestor of someone). So Eugene has no children (descendants) in the directed graph. Thus Eugene is a leaf (i.e., no descendant). Therefore Eugene cannot be ancestor of Donna (since that would require a directed path from Eugene to Donna). So answer 1 (Donna is Eugene's descendant) is false because that would require Eugene to be ancestor of Donna (i.e., there is a directed path from Eugene to Donna). Since Eugene has no outgoing edges, it cannot be ancestor of anyone. So answer 1 is not correct.\n\nNow, can Donna be ancestor of Eugene? That would require a directed path from Donna to Eugene (i.e., there is a chain of statements where each step is \"X is Y's ancestor\" (or \"Y is X's descendant\") such that we go from Donna to Eugene. Let's check if there is a directed path from Donna to Eugene. Since we have a chain that connects them (undirected), but the direction of each edge may be such that we can go from Donna to Eugene following the direction of edges (i.e., each step must be an ancestor to descendant direction). Let's see.\n\nWe need to find a path from Donna to Eugene where each step is consistent with the directed edges. Let's examine the chain we wrote in the forward direction (i.e., from Donna to Eugene). At each step, we need to see if the direction of the edge matches the direction of the chain.\n\nWe have the chain of relationships as we wrote: Donna -> Alexis (Donna descendant of Alexis). The edge direction is Alexis -> Donna. So moving from Donna to Alexis is opposite direction of edge. So that step is not allowed if we require directed edges. So we cannot go from Donna to Alexis using a forward edge. But we could go from Alexis to Donna using forward edge. But we need to go from Donna to Eugene, so we need to start at Donna and go to an ancestor (i.e., we need to go backwards). So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, we could go from Donna to some descendant? Does Donna have any outgoing edges? Let's see: Donna appears only in \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" So there is no statement where Donna is ancestor of someone else. So Donna has no outgoing edges either. So Donna cannot be ancestor of anyone else. So Donna cannot be ancestor of Eugene. So answer 2 (Donna is Eugene's ancestor) is false.\n\nThus Donna and Eugene are not directly ancestor/descendant.\n\nNow, do they share a common ancestor? That would require some node X such that X is ancestor of both Donna and Eugene (i.e., there is a directed path from X to Donna and from X to Eugene). Since Eugene has no outgoing edges, the only way X can be ancestor of Eugene is if X is a direct ancestor (i.e., edge from X to Eugene). The only statement involving Eugene is \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So X must be Bradley (or any ancestor of Bradley). So any ancestor of Bradley is also ancestor of Eugene (by transitivity). So any node that is an ancestor of Bradley (i.e., a node that has a directed path to Bradley) is an ancestor of Eugene. So we need to find if there is a node that is an ancestor of both Donna and Eugene. That is, find a node X such that there is a directed path X -> ... -> Donna and X -> ... -> Eugene. Since Eugene's only ancestors are those that have a directed path to Bradley (or to Eugene directly). Let's find ancestors of Eugene:\n\n- Direct ancestor: Bradley (edge Bradley -> Eugene). So Bradley is an ancestor of Eugene.\n\n- Ancestors of Bradley: We need to find all nodes that have a directed path to Bradley. Looking at the statements: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Donald -> Bradley. Also \"Carolyn is Paul's ancestor\"? No, \"Paul is Carolyn's ancestor.\" So Paul -> Carolyn. Also \"Samuel is Paul's ancestor.\" => Samuel -> Paul. \"Keith is Samuel's ancestor.\" => Keith -> Samuel. \"Joe is Karen's descendant.\" => Karen -> Joe. \"Gerald is Karen's ancestor.\" => Gerald -> Karen. \"Kimberly is Gerald's ancestor.\" => Kimberly -> Gerald. \"Joshua is Kimberly's ancestor.\" => Joshua -> Kimberly. \"Michelle is Joshua's ancestor.\" => Michelle -> Joshua. \"Lawrence is Michelle's ancestor.\" => Lawrence -> Michelle. \"Teresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" => Evelyn -> Teresa. \"Evelyn is Jeffrey's ancestor.\" => Jeffrey -> Evelyn. \"Jack is Rachel's descendant.\" => Rachel -> Jack. \"Russell is Eric's descendant.\" => Eric -> Russell. \"Victoria is Brian's ancestor.\" => Brian -> Victoria. \"Jacob is Brian's ancestor.\" => Jacob -> Brian. \"Gary is Jacob's ancestor.\" => Gary -> Jacob. \"Joyce is Henry's descendant.\" => Henry -> Joyce. \"Julie is Henry's ancestor.\" => Julie -> Henry. \"Mark is George's descendant.\" => George -> Mark. \"Kelly is George's ancestor.\" => Kelly -> George. \"Richard is Thomas's ancestor.\" => Thomas -> Richard. \"Kayla is Thomas's ancestor.\" => Kayla -> Thomas. \"Christian is Kayla's ancestor.\" => Christian -> Kayla. \"Harold is Christian's ancestor.\" => Harold -> Christian. \"Zachary is Harold's ancestor.\" => Zachary -> Harold. \"Wayne is Margaret's ancestor.\" => Margaret -> Wayne. \"Jason is Margaret's ancestor.\" => Jason -> Margaret. \"Brenda is Jason's ancestor.\" => Brenda -> Jason. \"Ronald is Barbara's ancestor.\" => Ronald -> Barbara. \"Michael is Andrew's ancestor.\" => Michael -> Andrew. \"Julia is Andrew's descendant.\" => Andrew -> Julia. \"Diana is John's ancestor.\" => Diana -> John. \"John is Katherine's ancestor.\" => John -> Katherine. \"Bruce is Katherine's descendant.\" => Katherine -> Bruce. \"Raymond is Abigail's ancestor.\" => Raymond -> Abigail. \"Janice is Albert's ancestor.\" => Janice -> Albert. \"Shirley is Albert's descendant.\" => Albert -> Shirley. \"Jerry is Diane's ancestor.\" => Jerry -> Diane. \"Lori is Danielle's ancestor.\" => Danielle -> Lori? Actually \"Danielle is Lori's descendant.\" => Lori -> Danielle. So we have many edges.\n\nThus the ancestors of Bradley are: Donald, Carolyn, Paul, Samuel, Keith, ... etc. Let's compute ancestors of Bradley systematically.\n\nGiven the directed edges (ancestor->descendant), we can compute ancestors of each node.\n\nBut perhaps there is a more direct approach: Since the chain we found is a path connecting Donna and Eugene via many intermediate nodes, and each intermediate node is an ancestor of Donna (as we argued). However, we need to check if any of those intermediate nodes are ancestors of Eugene. Since Eugene's ancestors are nodes that have a directed path to Eugene (i.e., nodes that are ancestors of Eugene). The only immediate ancestor is Bradley, and then its ancestors include Donald, etc. So we need to see if any node in the chain (except perhaps some) is an ancestor of Eugene. If any node is an ancestor of both Donna and Eugene, then they share a common ancestor.\n\nFrom the chain, we have many nodes: Donna, Alexis, Sara, Natalie, Ethan, Danielle, Lori, Diane, Jerry, Shirley, Albert, Janice, Abigail, Raymond, Bruce, Katherine, John, Diana, Julia, Andrew, Michael, Barbara, Ronald, Brenda, Jason, Margaret, Wayne, Zachary, Harold, Christian, Kayla, Thomas, Richard, Kelly, George, Mark, Julie, Henry, Joyce, Gary, Jacob, Brian, Victoria, Eric, Russell, Rachel, Jack, Jeffrey, Evelyn, Teresa, Lawrence, Michelle, Joshua, Kimberly, Gerald, Karen, Joe, Keith, Samuel, Paul, Carolyn, Donald, Bradley, Eugene.\n\nNow, which of these are ancestors of Eugene? Let's list ancestors of Eugene: Starting from Eugene, we have incoming edge from Bradley. So Bradley is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Bradley, we have incoming edge from Donald. So Donald is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Donald, incoming edge from Carolyn. So Carolyn is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Carolyn, incoming edge from Paul. So Paul is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Paul, incoming edge from Samuel. So Samuel is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Samuel, incoming edge from Keith. So Keith is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Keith, incoming edge from Joe. So Joe is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Joe, incoming edge from Karen. So Karen is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Karen, incoming edge from Gerald. So Gerald is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Gerald, incoming edge from Kimberly. So Kimberly is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Kimberly, incoming edge from Joshua. So Joshua is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Joshua, incoming edge from Michelle. So Michelle is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Michelle, incoming edge from Lawrence. So Lawrence is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Lawrence, incoming edge from Teresa. So Teresa is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Teresa, incoming edge from Evelyn. So Evelyn is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Evelyn, incoming edge from Jeffrey. So Jeffrey is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Jeffrey, incoming edge from Jack. So Jack is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Jack, incoming edge from Rachel. So Rachel is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Rachel, incoming edge from Russell. So Russell is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Russell, incoming edge from Eric. So Eric is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Eric, incoming edge from Victoria. So Victoria is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Victoria, incoming edge from Brian. So Brian is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Brian, incoming edge from Jacob. So Jacob is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Jacob, incoming edge from Gary. So Gary is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Gary, incoming edge from Joyce. So Joyce is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Joyce, incoming edge from Henry. So Henry is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Henry, incoming edge from Julie. So Julie is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Julie, incoming edge from Mark. So Mark is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Mark, incoming edge from George. So George is ancestor of Eugene. Then from George, incoming edge from Kelly. So Kelly is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Kelly, incoming edge from Richard. So Richard is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Richard, incoming edge from Thomas. So Thomas is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Thomas, incoming edge from Kayla. So Kayla is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Kayla, incoming edge from Christian. So Christian is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Christian, incoming edge from Harold. So Harold is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Harold, incoming edge from Zachary. So Zachary is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Zachary, incoming edge from Wayne. So Wayne is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Wayne, incoming edge from Margaret. So Margaret is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Margaret, incoming edge from Jason. So Jason is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Jason, incoming edge from Brenda. So Brenda is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Brenda, incoming edge from Ronald. So Ronald is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Ronald, incoming edge from Barbara. So Barbara is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Barbara, incoming edge from Michael. So Michael is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Michael, incoming edge from Andrew. So Andrew is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Andrew, incoming edge from Julia. So Julia is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Julia, incoming edge from Diana. So Diana is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Diana, incoming edge from John. So John is ancestor of Eugene. Then from John, incoming edge from Katherine. So Katherine is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Katherine, incoming edge from Bruce. So Bruce is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Bruce, incoming edge from Raymond. So Raymond is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Raymond, incoming edge from Abigail. So Abigail is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Abigail, incoming edge from Janice. So Janice is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Janice, incoming edge from Albert. So Albert is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Albert, incoming edge from Shirley. So Shirley is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Shirley, incoming edge from Jerry. So Jerry is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Jerry, incoming edge from Diane. So Diane is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Diane, incoming edge from Lori. So Lori is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Lori, incoming edge from Danielle. So Danielle is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Danielle, incoming edge from Ethan. So Ethan is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Ethan, incoming edge from Natalie. So Natalie is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Natalie, incoming edge from Sara. So Sara is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Sara, incoming edge from Alexis. So Alexis is ancestor of Eugene. Then from Alexis, incoming edge from ??? Actually, we need to see if Alexis has any incoming edges. The only statement involving Alexis is \"Donna is Alexis's descendant.\" So Alexis is ancestor of Donna. Also \"Sara is Alexis's ancestor.\" So Sara is ancestor of Alexis. So Alexis has an incoming edge from Sara (Sara -> Alexis). So Alexis is descendant of Sara, which we already have. So the chain continues: Alexis is descendant of Sara, which is descendant of Natalie, etc. So eventually, we need to see if there is a path from some node to Donna. But we need to find if any node is ancestor of both Donna and Eugene.\n\nThus we see that many nodes are ancestors of Eugene. Indeed, the chain we listed includes many nodes that are ancestors of Eugene (starting from Bradley downwards). Let's verify: Are all nodes in the chain ancestors of Eugene? Let's check each node:\n\n- Donna: Not ancestor of Eugene, because Donna is descendant of Alexis, not ancestor of Eugene. Donna has no outgoing edges, so cannot be ancestor of Eugene.\n\n- Alexis: Alexis is ancestor of Donna (edge Alexis -> Donna). Does Alexis have a directed path to Eugene? Let's see: Is there a path from Alexis to Eugene? We need to see if there is a directed path from Alexis to any of the nodes that are ancestors of Eugene. Let's check if Alexis is ancestor of any of the nodes that are ancestors of Eugene. The chain of ancestors of Eugene includes many nodes, but we need to see if Alexis is in that chain. Let's see the chain we listed: Starting from Eugene, go to Bradley, then to Donald, then to Carolyn, then to Paul, then to Samuel, then to Keith, then to Joe, then to Karen, then to Gerald, then to Kimberly, then to Joshua, then to Michelle, then to Lawrence, then to Teresa, then to Evelyn, then to Jeffrey, then to Jack, then to Rachel, then to Russell, then to Eric, then to Victoria, then to Brian, then to Jacob, then to Gary, then to Joyce, then to Henry, then to Julie, then to Mark, then to George, then to Kelly, then to Richard, then to Thomas, then to Kayla, then to Christian, then to Harold, then to Zachary, then to Wayne, then to Margaret, then to Jason, then to Brenda, then to Ronald, then to Barbara, then to Michael, then to Andrew, then to Julia, then to Diana, then to John, then to Katherine, then to Bruce, then to Raymond, then to Abigail, then to Janice, then to Albert, then to Shirley, then to Jerry, then to Diane, then to Lori, then to Danielle, then to Ethan, then to Natalie, then to Sara, then to Alexis, then to ??? (maybe some other node). So Alexis appears in the chain of ancestors of Eugene. Indeed, we have a path: Eugene <- Bradley <- Donald <- ... <- Alexis (via many steps). So Alexis is an ancestor of Eugene. Let's verify: The chain we listed shows that Alexis is ancestor of Eugene, because we have a path from Alexis to Eugene via many steps. Actually, we need to check the direction of edges for each step. Let's verify the chain from Alexis to Eugene: Starting from Alexis, we have \"Alexis is descendant of Sara.\" So Sara -> Alexis. Then \"Sara is descendant of Natalie.\" So Natalie -> Sara. Then \"Natalie is descendant of Ethan.\" So Ethan -> Natalie. Then \"Ethan is descendant of Danielle.\" So Danielle -> Ethan. Then \"Danielle is descendant of Lori.\" So Lori -> Danielle. Then \"Lori is descendant of Diane.\" So Diane -> Lori. Then \"Diane is descendant of Jerry.\" So Jerry -> Diane. Then \"Jerry is descendant of Shirley.\" So Shirley -> Jerry. Then \"Shirley is descendant of Albert.\" So Albert -> Shirley. Then \"Albert is descendant of Janice.\" So Janice -> Albert. Then \"Janice is descendant of Abigail.\" So Abigail -> Janice. Then \"Abigail is descendant of Raymond.\" So Raymond -> Abigail. Then \"Raymond is descendant of Bruce.\" So Bruce -> Raymond. Then \"Bruce is descendant of Katherine.\" So Katherine -> Bruce. Then \"Katherine is descendant of John.\" So John -> Katherine. Then \"John is descendant of Diana.\" So Diana -> John. Then \"Diana is descendant of Julia.\" So Julia -> Diana. Then \"Julia is descendant of Andrew.\" So Andrew -> Julia. Then \"Andrew is descendant of Michael.\" So Michael -> Andrew. Then \"Michael is descendant of Barbara.\" So Barbara -> Michael. Then \"Barbara is descendant of Ronald.\" So Ronald -> Barbara. Then \"Ronald is descendant of Brenda.\" So Brenda -> Ronald. Then \"Brenda is descendant of Jason.\" So Jason -> Brenda. Then \"Jason is descendant of Margaret.\" So Margaret -> Jason. Then \"Margaret is descendant of Wayne.\" So Wayne -> Margaret. Then \"Wayne is descendant of Zachary.\" So Zachary -> Wayne. Then \"Zachary is descendant of Harold.\" So Harold -> Zachary. Then \"Harold is descendant of Christian.\" So Christian -> Harold. Then \"Christian is descendant of Kayla.\" So Kayla -> Christian. Then \"Kayla is descendant of Thomas.\" So Thomas -> Kayla. Then \"Thomas is descendant of Richard.\" So Richard -> Thomas. Then \"Richard is descendant of Kelly.\" So Kelly -> Richard. Then \"Kelly is descendant of George.\" So George -> Kelly. Then \"George is descendant of Mark.\" So Mark -> George. Then \"Mark is descendant of Julie.\" So Julie -> Mark. Then \"Julie is descendant of Henry.\" So Henry -> Julie. Then \"Henry is descendant of Joyce.\" So Joyce -> Henry. Then \"Joyce is descendant of Gary.\" So Gary -> Joyce. Then \"Gary is descendant of Jacob.\" So Jacob -> Gary. Then \"Jacob is descendant of Brian.\" So Brian -> Jacob. Then \"Brian is descendant of Victoria.\" So Victoria -> Brian. Then \"Victoria is descendant of Eric.\" So Eric -> Victoria. Then \"Eric is descendant of Russell.\" So Russell -> Eric. Then \"Russell is descendant of Rachel.\" So Rachel -> Russell. Then \"Rachel is descendant of Jack.\" So Jack -> Rachel. Then \"Jack is descendant of Jeffrey.\" So Jeffrey -> Jack. Then \"Jeffrey is descendant of Evelyn.\" So Evelyn -> Jeffrey. Then \"Evelyn is descendant of Teresa.\" So Teresa -> Evelyn. Then \"Teresa is descendant of Lawrence.\" So Lawrence -> Teresa. Then \"Lawrence is descendant of Michelle.\" So Michelle -> Lawrence. Then \"Michelle is descendant of Joshua.\" So Joshua -> Michelle. Then \"Joshua is descendant of Kimberly.\" So Kimberly -> Joshua. Then \"Kimberly is descendant of Gerald.\" So Gerald -> Kimberly. Then \"Gerald is descendant of Karen.\" So Karen -> Gerald. Then \"Karen is descendant of Joe.\" So Joe -> Karen. Then \"Joe is descendant of Keith.\" So Keith -> Joe. Then \"Keith is descendant of Samuel.\" So Samuel -> Keith. Then \"Samuel is descendant of Paul.\" So Paul -> Samuel. Then \"Paul is descendant of Carolyn.\" So Carolyn -> Paul. Then \"Carolyn is descendant of Donald.\" So Donald -> Carolyn. Then \"Donald is descendant of Bradley.\" So Bradley -> Donald. Then \"Bradley is descendant of Eugene.\" So Eugene -> Bradley. Wait, this is the opposite: \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley -> Eugene (ancestor to descendant). So the direction is Bradley -> Eugene. So we have a directed path from Bradley to Eugene. But we have a directed path from Eugene to Bradley? No, we have edge from Bradley to Eugene. So moving from Eugene to Bradley is opposite direction. So we cannot go from Alexis to Eugene via directed edges following the direction we just described. Actually, we need to check the direction for each step in the chain from Alexis to Eugene. Let's list the directed edges for each step:\n\n- Alexis -> Donna (Alexis ancestor of Donna). So edge Alexis -> Donna.\n\n- Sara -> Alexis (Sara ancestor of Alexis). So edge Sara -> Alexis.\n\n- Natalie -> Sara (Natalie ancestor of Sara). So edge Natalie -> Sara.\n\n- Ethan -> Natalie (Ethan ancestor of Natalie). So edge Ethan -> Natalie.\n\n- Danielle -> Ethan (Danielle ancestor of Ethan). So edge Danielle -> Ethan.\n\n- Lori -> Danielle (Lori ancestor of Danielle). So edge Lori -> Danielle.\n\n- Diane -> Lori (Diane ancestor of Lori). So edge Diane -> Lori.\n\n- Jerry -> Diane (Jerry ancestor of Diane). So edge Jerry -> Diane.\n\n- Shirley -> Jerry (Shirley ancestor of Jerry). So edge Shirley -> Jerry.\n\n- Albert -> Shirley (Albert ancestor of Shirley). So edge Albert -> Shirley.\n\n- Janice -> Albert (Janice ancestor of Albert). So edge Janice -> Albert.\n\n- Abigail -> Janice (Abigail ancestor of Janice). So edge Abigail -> Janice.\n\n- Raymond -> Abigail (Raymond ancestor of Abigail). So edge Raymond -> Abigail.\n\n- Bruce -> Raymond (Bruce ancestor of Raymond). So edge Bruce -> Raymond.\n\n- Katherine -> Bruce (Katherine ancestor of Bruce). So edge Katherine -> Bruce.\n\n- John -> Katherine (John ancestor of Katherine). So edge John -> Katherine.\n\n- Diana -> John (Diana ancestor of John). So edge Diana -> John.\n\n- Julia -> Diana (Julia ancestor of Diana). So edge Julia -> Diana.\n\n- Andrew -> Julia (Andrew ancestor of Julia). So edge Andrew -> Julia.\n\n- Michael -> Andrew (Michael ancestor of Andrew). So edge Michael -> Andrew.\n\n- Barbara -> Michael (Barbara ancestor of Michael). So edge Barbara -> Michael.\n\n- Ronald -> Barbara (Ronald ancestor of Barbara). So edge Ronald -> Barbara.\n\n- Brenda -> Ronald (Brenda ancestor of Ronald). So edge Brenda -> Ronald.\n\n- Jason -> Brenda (Jason ancestor of Brenda). So edge Jason -> Brenda.\n\n- Margaret -> Jason (Margaret ancestor of Jason). So edge Margaret -> Jason.\n\n- Wayne -> Margaret (Wayne ancestor of Margaret).

So edge Harold -> Zachary.\n\n- Christian -> Harold (Christian ancestor of Harold). So edge Christian -> Harold.\n\n- Kayla -> Christian (Kayla ancestor of Christian).

So edge Victoria -> Brian.\n\n- Eric -> Victoria (Eric ancestor of Victoria). So edge Eric -> Victoria.\n\n- Russell -> Eric (Russell ancestor of Eric). So edge Russell -> Eric.\n\n- Rachel -> Russell (Rachel ancestor of Russell). So edge Rachel -> Russell.\n\n- Jack -> Rachel (Jack ancestor of Rachel). So edge Jack -> Rachel.\n\n- Jeffrey -> Jack (Jeffrey ancestor of Jack). So edge Jeffrey -> Jack.\n\n- Evelyn -> Jeffrey (Evelyn ancestor of Jeffrey). So edge Evelyn -> Jeffrey.\n\n- Teresa -> Evelyn (Teresa ancestor of Evelyn). So edge Teresa -> Evelyn.\n\n- Lawrence -> Teresa (Lawrence ancestor of Teresa). So edge Lawrence -> Teresa.\n\n- Michelle -> Lawrence (Michelle ancestor of Lawrence). So edge Michelle -> Lawrence.\n\n- Joshua -> Michelle (Joshua ancestor of Michelle). So edge Joshua -> Michelle.\n\n- Kimberly -> Joshua (Kimberly ancestor of Joshua). So edge Kimberly -> Joshua.\n\n- Gerald -> Kimberly (Gerald ancestor of Kimberly).

So edge Joe -> Karen.\n\n- Keith -> Joe (Keith ancestor of Joe). So edge Keith -> Joe.\n\n- Samuel -> Keith (Samuel ancestor of Keith). So edge Samuel -> Keith.\n\n- Paul -> Samuel (Paul ancestor of Samuel). So edge Paul -> Samuel.\n\n- Carolyn -> Paul (Carolyn ancestor of Paul). So edge Carolyn -> Paul.\n\n- Donald -> Carolyn (Donald ancestor of Carolyn). So edge Donald -> Carolyn.\n\n- Bradley -> Donald (Bradley ancestor of Donald). So edge Bradley -> Donald.\n\n- Eugene -> Bradley (Eugene is descendant of Bradley). Actually, the statement \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So edge Bradley -> Eugene (ancestor to descendant). So we have edge Bradley -> Eugene.\n\nThus the directed edges are from ancestor to descendant as listed.\n\nNow, we can see a directed path from Alexis to Eugene? Let's see: Starting from Alexis, we have edge Alexis -> Donna (to Donna). Then from Donna, there is no outgoing edge (Donna has no statements where Donna is ancestor). So we cannot go further. So Alexis cannot be ancestor of Eugene (since there's no path from Alexis to Eugene). However, we could go from Alexis upstream (to its ancestors) but that would be opposite direction.\n\nThus the directed path from any node to Eugene must follow the direction of edges (ancestor to descendant). So to find common ancestors of both Donna and Eugene, we need to find nodes that have directed paths to both Donna and Eugene. Let's find all ancestors of Donna (i.e., nodes that have directed paths to Donna). Since Donna has only incoming edge from Alexis (Alexis -> Donna). So the only direct ancestor of Donna is Alexis. Then any node that is ancestor of Alexis (i.e., has a directed path to Alexis) is also an ancestor of Donna (by transitivity). So we need to find all nodes that have directed paths to Alexis.\n\nWe have edges: Sara -> Alexis, Natalie -> Sara, Ethan -> Natalie, Danielle -> Ethan, Lori -> Danielle, Diane -> Lori, Jerry -> Diane, Shirley -> Jerry, Albert -> Shirley, Janice -> Albert, Abigail -> Janice, Raymond -> Abigail, Bruce -> Raymond, Katherine -> Bruce, John -> Katherine, Diana -> John, Julia -> Diana, Andrew -> Julia, Michael -> Andrew, Barbara -> Michael, Ronald -> Barbara, Brenda -> Ronald, Jason -> Brenda, Margaret -> Jason, Wayne -> Margaret, Zachary -> Wayne, Harold -> Zachary, Christian -> Harold, Kayla -> Christian, Thomas -> Kayla, Richard -> Thomas, Kelly -> Richard, George -> Kelly, Mark -> George, Julie -> Mark, Henry -> Julie, Joyce -> Henry, Gary -> Joyce, Jacob -> Gary, Brian -> Jacob, Victoria -> Brian, Eric -> Victoria, Russell -> Eric, Rachel -> Russell, Jack -> Rachel, Jeffrey -> Jack, Evelyn -> Jeffrey, Teresa -> Evelyn, Lawrence -> Teresa, Michelle -> Lawrence, Joshua -> Michelle, Kimberly -> Joshua, Gerald -> Kimberly, Karen -> Gerald, Joe -> Karen, Keith -> Joe, Samuel -> Keith, Paul -> Samuel, Carolyn -> Paul, Donald -> Carolyn, Bradley -> Donald, Eugene -> Bradley? Wait, the edge is Bradley -> Eugene. So there is no edge from Eugene to Bradley. So the directed path from any node to Eugene must end with Bradley -> Eugene. So the ancestors of Eugene are all nodes that have a directed path to Bradley (including Bradley). So we need to find nodes that have directed path to both Donna (i.e., to Alexis) and to Bradley. However, we see that the directed graph is a huge tree (or DAG) where each node has a unique parent? Not necessarily; there may be multiple parents.\n\nBut we need to find a node that is ancestor of both Donna and Eugene. Since Donna's only ancestors are nodes that can reach Alexis (including Alexis, Sara, Natalie, etc.), and Eugene's ancestors are nodes that can reach Bradley (including Bradley, Donald, etc.). So we need to find a node that is both an ancestor of Alexis (i.e., can reach Alexis) and an ancestor of Bradley (i.e., can reach Bradley). If such a node exists, then Donna and Eugene share a common ancestor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a node that is a common ancestor of both Donna and Eugene (i.e., there is a node X such that X has directed paths to both Donna and Eugene). Let's examine the directed graph.\n\nGiven the chain we listed (the directed edges), we see that the graph seems to be a long chain (almost a linear chain) but with some branching? Let's examine the edges more closely.\n\nThe edges we listed are all from older to younger (ancestor to descendant). The chain appears to be a linear chain: each node appears as a child of exactly one parent, except maybe some nodes have multiple children? Let's check.\n\nWe have many nodes, but each node appears in exactly one \"X is Y's ancestor\" statement (as X) and maybe also in \"Z is Y's descendant\" statements (as Y). For each node, there may be multiple outgoing edges (if it is ancestor of multiple people). Let's examine the graph to see if it's a tree.\n\nList all statements again with the directed edges:\n\n1.

Ethan is Natalie's ancestor. => Ethan -> Natalie (E->N)\n\nNow we have a directed graph.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Donna and Eugene. Let's compute the ancestors (i.e., reachable nodes) for each.\n\nFirst, compute ancestors of Donna (i.e., nodes that can reach Donna via directed edges). Starting from Donna, we follow reverse edges (i.e., go to its parent(s)). Donna has incoming edge from Alexis (Alexis -> Donna). So Alexis is a direct ancestor. Alexis also has incoming edge from Sara (Sara -> Alexis). So Sara is ancestor. Sara has incoming edge from Natalie (Natalie -> Sara). So Natalie is ancestor. Natalie has incoming edge from Ethan (Ethan -> Natalie). So Ethan is ancestor. Ethan has incoming edge from Danielle (Danielle -> Ethan). So Danielle is ancestor.

Shirley has incoming edge from Albert (Albert -> Shirley). So Albert is ancestor. Albert has incoming edge from Janice (Janice -> Albert). So Janice is ancestor. Janice has incoming edge from Abigail (Abigail -> Janice). So Abigail is ancestor. Abigail has incoming edge from Raymond (Raymond -> Abigail). So Raymond is ancestor. Raymond has incoming edge from Bruce (Bruce -> Raymond). So Bruce is ancestor. Bruce has incoming edge from Katherine (Katherine -> Bruce). So Katherine is ancestor. Katherine has incoming edge from John (John -> Katherine). So John is ancestor. John has incoming edge from Diana (Diana -> John). So Diana is ancestor. Diana has incoming edge from Julia (Julia -> Diana). So Julia is ancestor. Julia has incoming edge from Andrew (Andrew -> Julia). So Andrew is ancestor. Andrew has incoming edge from Michael (Michael -> Andrew). So Michael is ancestor. Michael has incoming edge from Barbara (Barbara -> Michael). So Barbara is ancestor. Barbara has incoming edge from Ronald (Ronald -> Barbara). So Ronald is ancestor. Ronald has incoming edge from Brenda (Brenda -> Ronald). So Brenda is ancestor. Brenda has incoming edge from Jason (Jason -> Brenda). So Jason is ancestor. Jason has incoming edge from Margaret (Margaret -> Jason). So Margaret is ancestor. Margaret has incoming edge from Wayne (Wayne -> Margaret). So Wayne is ancestor. Wayne has incoming edge from Zachary (Zachary -> Wayne). So Zachary is ancestor. Zachary has incoming edge from Harold (Harold -> Zachary). So Harold is ancestor. Harold has incoming edge from Christian (Christian -> Harold). So Christian is ancestor. Christian has incoming edge from Kayla (Kayla -> Christian). So Kayla is ancestor. Kayla has incoming edge from Thomas (Thomas -> Kayla). So Thomas is ancestor. Thomas has incoming edge from Richard (Richard -> Thomas). So Richard is ancestor. Richard has incoming edge from Kelly (Kelly -> Richard). So Kelly is ancestor. Kelly has incoming edge from George (George -> Kelly). So George is ancestor. George has incoming edge from Mark (Mark -> George). So Mark is ancestor. Mark has incoming edge from Julie (Julie -> Mark). So Julie is ancestor. Julie has incoming edge from Henry (Henry -> Julie). So Henry is ancestor. Henry has incoming edge from Joyce (Joyce -> Henry). So Joyce is ancestor. Joyce has incoming edge from Gary (Gary -> Joyce). So Gary is ancestor. Gary has incoming edge from Jacob (Jacob -> Gary). So Jacob is ancestor. Jacob has incoming edge from Brian (Brian -> Jacob). So Brian is ancestor. Brian has incoming edge from Victoria (Victoria -> Brian). So Victoria is ancestor. Victoria has incoming edge from Eric (Eric -> Victoria). So Eric is ancestor. Eric has incoming edge from Russell (Russell -> Eric). So Russell is ancestor. Russell has incoming edge from Rachel (Rachel -> Russell). So Rachel is ancestor. Rachel has incoming edge from Jack (Jack -> Rachel). So Jack is ancestor. Jack has incoming edge from Jeffrey (Jeffrey -> Jack). So Jeffrey is ancestor. Jeffrey has incoming edge from Evelyn (Evelyn -> Jeffrey). So Evelyn is ancestor. Evelyn has incoming edge from Teresa (Teresa -> Evelyn). So Teresa is ancestor. Teresa has incoming edge from Lawrence (Lawrence -> Teresa). So Lawrence is ancestor. Lawrence has incoming edge from Michelle (Michelle -> Lawrence). So Michelle is ancestor. Michelle has incoming edge from Joshua (Joshua -> Michelle). So Joshua is ancestor. Joshua has incoming edge from Kimberly (Kimberly -> Joshua). So Kimberly is ancestor. Kimberly has incoming edge from Gerald (Gerald -> Kimberly). So Gerald is ancestor. Gerald has incoming edge from Karen (Karen -> Gerald). So Karen is ancestor. Karen has incoming edge from Joe (Joe -> Karen). So Joe is ancestor. Joe has incoming edge from Keith (Keith -> Joe). So Keith is ancestor. Keith has incoming edge from Samuel (Samuel -> Keith). So Samuel is ancestor. Samuel has incoming edge from Paul (Paul -> Samuel). So Paul is ancestor. Paul has incoming edge from Carolyn (Carolyn -> Paul). So Carolyn is ancestor. Carolyn has incoming edge from Donald (Donald -> Carolyn). So Donald is ancestor. Donald has incoming edge from Bradley (Bradley -> Donald). So Bradley is ancestor. Bradley has incoming edge from ??? Actually, Bradley's only parent is ??? Let's check: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Donald -> Bradley. So Bradley has incoming edge from Donald. So that's it. So the ancestors of Donna include all these nodes, up to Bradley and beyond? Actually, after Bradley, there is no further parent (Bradley has only incoming edge from Donald). So the ancestors of Donna include Bradley, Donald, etc., all the way up to maybe some root (maybe no root). So the ancestors of Donna are all nodes in the chain we listed: from Bradley upwards? Wait, we listed ancestors of Donna by following incoming edges from Donna up to the root. So we started at Donna and moved upward: Donna -> Alexis -> Sara -> Natalie -> Ethan -> Danielle -> Lori -> Diane -> Jerry -> Shirley -> Albert -> Janice -> Abigail -> Raymond -> Bruce -> Katherine -> John -> Diana -> Julia -> Andrew -> Michael -> Barbara -> Ronald -> Brenda -> Jason -> Margaret -> Wayne -> Zachary -> Harold -> Christian -> Kayla -> Thomas -> Richard -> Kelly -> George -> Mark -> Julie -> Henry -> Joyce -> Gary -> Jacob -> Brian -> Victoria -> Eric -> Russell -> Rachel -> Jack -> Jeffrey -> Evelyn -> Teresa -> Lawrence -> Michelle -> Joshua -> Kimberly -> Gerald -> Karen -> Joe -> Keith -> Samuel -> Paul -> Carolyn -> Donald -> Bradley (and then maybe stop because Bradley has no parent except Donald). Actually, Bradley has incoming edge from Donald. So after Bradley, we go to Donald, then to Carolyn, etc. So the ancestors of Donna include Bradley, Donald, Carolyn, Paul, Samuel, Keith, etc., all the way up to the root. So the ancestors of Donna include many nodes, including Bradley and Donald, etc. So indeed, Bradley and Donald are ancestors of Donna. Thus we have a directed path from Bradley to Donna: Bradley -> Donald -> Carolyn -> Paul -> Samuel -> Keith -> ... -> eventually to Donna? Wait, we need to verify that there is a directed path from Bradley to Donna following edges from ancestor to descendant. Let's see: Starting from Bradley, we have edge Bradley -> Donald (since Donald is descendant of Bradley). Actually, \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" Wait, that is \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So edge Donald -> Bradley? Let's double-check: The statement \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" Means Donald is ancestor of Bradley. So edge Donald -> Bradley (ancestor to descendant). Wait, we need to be careful: The statement \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" Means Donald is ancestor of Bradley. So edge Donald -> Bradley (Donald is ancestor, Bradley is descendant). So the direction is Donald -> Bradley. So Bradley is descendant of Donald. So the edge is Donald -> Bradley. So we have edge Donald -> Bradley. So from Bradley we cannot go to Donald (since edge is incoming to Bradley). So we cannot follow a path from Bradley to Donna via forward edges. But we can follow a path from Donald to Bradley (Donald -> Bradley) and then to ??? But we need a path from Donald to Donna. Let's see if there is a directed path from Donald to Donna. Starting from Donald, we have edge Donald -> Bradley (since Donald is ancestor of Bradley). Then from Bradley, we have edge Bradley -> Eugene? Actually, \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So edge Bradley -> Eugene. So from Bradley we can go to Eugene. Then from Eugene, no outgoing edges. So we cannot go further. So Donald cannot reach Donna via forward edges.\n\nThus the ancestors of Donna we listed are all nodes that have a directed path to Donna (i.e., they are ancestors). However, we need to verify that each of those nodes indeed has a directed path to Donna. Let's check a few: Starting from Donald, does Donald have a directed path to Donna? We have Donald -> Bradley -> ??? Actually, we need to see if there is a path from Donald to Donna. Let's examine the directed edges for each node:\n\n- Donald -> Bradley (Donald is ancestor of Bradley). Then from Bradley, we have edge Bradley -> Eugene (Bradley is ancestor of Eugene). Then from Eugene, no outgoing edges. So Donald cannot reach Donna via forward edges. So Donald is not an ancestor of Donna in the directed sense. Wait, but earlier we said Donna's ancestors include Donald, because we followed reverse edges (i.e., we started at Donna and went backward along edges). However, the reverse direction does not guarantee that the nodes we reach are ancestors of Donna in the forward sense (i.e., they have a directed path to Donna). Actually, they do: If we go backward from Donna to its parent(s) (incoming edges), those nodes are indeed ancestors of Donna (since there is a directed edge from them to Donna). For example, Alexis -> Donna is a directed edge. So Alexis is an ancestor of Donna. Then from Alexis, we have an incoming edge from Sara (Sara -> Alexis). So there is a directed edge from Sara to Alexis, and from Alexis to Donna. So there is a path Sara -> Alexis -> Donna. So Sara is an ancestor of Donna. Similarly, we can trace back: Starting from Donna, we go to Alexis, then to Sara, then to Natalie, etc. So each step we go to a node that has a directed edge to the previous node. So the chain we traced is indeed a directed path from each ancestor to the next, eventually to Donna. So all those nodes are ancestors of Donna in the directed sense.\n\nThus the ancestors of Donna are exactly the nodes we listed (including Bradley, Donald, etc.) because we can follow the chain from each node to Donna via the directed edges we listed. Let's verify for Donald: Does Donald have a directed path to Donna? Let's see: Donald -> ??? We need to find a path from Donald to Donna. Starting from Donald, we have edge Donald -> Bradley? Wait, we need to check the direction again: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" Means Donald is ancestor of Bradley. So edge Donald -> Bradley (ancestor to descendant). So from Donald we go to Bradley. Then from Bradley, we have edge Bradley -> Eugene (Bradley ancestor of Eugene). But we need to go from Bradley to a node that leads to Donna. However, we need to see if there is a path from Bradley to Donna. In the chain we traced from Donna upward, we saw that after Bradley, we go to Donald, then to Carolyn, etc. But that was moving backward (i.e., from Donna to Bradley via reverse edges). Let's examine the chain again: Starting at Donna, we go to Alexis (incoming edge). Then to Sara (incoming). Then to Natalie (incoming). Then to Ethan (incoming). Then to Danielle (incoming). Then to Lori (incoming). Then to Diane (incoming). Then to Jerry (incoming). Then to Shirley (incoming). Then to Albert (incoming). Then to Janice (incoming). Then to Abigail (incoming). Then to Raymond (incoming). Then to Bruce (incoming). Then to Katherine (incoming). Then to John (incoming). Then to Diana (incoming). Then to Julia (incoming). Then to Andrew (incoming). Then to Michael (incoming). Then to Barbara (incoming). Then to Ronald (incoming). Then to Brenda (incoming). Then to Jason (incoming). Then to Margaret (incoming). Then to Wayne (incoming). Then to Zachary (incoming). Then to Harold (incoming). Then to Christian (incoming). Then to Kayla (incoming). Then to Thomas (incoming). Then to Richard (incoming). Then to Kelly (incoming). Then to George (incoming). Then to Mark (incoming). Then to Julie (incoming). Then to Henry (incoming). Then to Joyce (incoming). Then to Gary (incoming). Then to Jacob (incoming). Then to Brian (incoming). Then to Victoria (incoming). Then to Eric (incoming). Then to Russell (incoming). Then to Rachel (incoming). Then to Jack (incoming). Then to Jeffrey (incoming). Then to Evelyn (incoming). Then to Teresa (incoming). Then to Lawrence (incoming). Then to Michelle (incoming). Then to Joshua (incoming). Then to Kimberly (incoming). Then to Gerald (incoming). Then to Karen (incoming). Then to Joe (incoming). Then to Keith (incoming). Then to Samuel (incoming). Then to Paul (incoming). Then to Carolyn (incoming). Then to Donald (incoming). Then to Bradley (incoming). Then we stop because Bradley has no incoming edges? Actually, Bradley has incoming edge from Donald (since Donald is ancestor of Bradley). So we can continue: After Bradley, we go to Donald, then to Carolyn, then to Paul, then to Samuel, etc. Actually, we need to see if there is an incoming edge to Bradley from someone else? The statement \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Donald -> Bradley. So there is an incoming edge to Bradley from Donald. So we can continue: from Bradley we go to Donald (since Donald is ancestor of Bradley). But that would be moving upward to Donald (i.e., following reverse edges). However, we need to check if there is a directed path from Donald to Donna. Let's examine the directed edges for each node:\n\nWe have edges:\n\n- Donald -> Bradley (Donald is ancestor of Bradley).\n- Bradley -> ??? Actually, \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Bradley -> Eugene (Bradley ancestor of Eugene). So Bradley has outgoing edge to Eugene.\n- Donald also has outgoing edge to ... Actually, Donald is also descendant of Bradley? No, Donald is ancestor of Bradley, so Bradley is descendant of Donald. So the edge is Donald -> Bradley. So Donald's outgoing edges: Donald -> Bradley. Also Donald is descendant of ??? Actually, Donald is also descendant of ??? Let's see: \"Donald is Carolyn's descendant.\" Means Carolyn -> Donald (Carolyn ancestor of Donald). So Donald also has incoming edge from Carolyn. So Donald has outgoing edge to Bradley, incoming edge from Carolyn.\n\nThus the directed graph is a DAG (or maybe with cycles). Let's try to see if there is a directed path from Donald to Donna. Starting from Donald, we can go to Bradley. Then from Bradley, we can go to Eugene. Then from Eugene, no outgoing edges. So no path to Donna. So Donald cannot reach Donna via directed edges. But earlier we said Donald is an ancestor of Donna because we went backwards from Donna to Donald. However, that path is reversed: we went from Donna to Donald via reverse edges (i.e., we traversed edges in opposite direction). So Donald is not a directed ancestor of Donna; rather, Donna is a descendant of Donald? Wait, we need to be careful.\n\nThe concept of \"ancestor\" is directional: If there is a directed path from X to Y, then X is an ancestor of Y (X older, Y descendant). So if we have a directed edge from X to Y (X ancestor of Y), then X is an ancestor of Y, and Y is a descendant of X. So if we have a directed edge from Alexis to Donna, then Alexis is ancestor of Donna. If we have a directed edge from Sara to Alexis, then Sara is ancestor of Alexis (and thus ancestor of Donna). So the chain we traced backwards from Donna to Sara, Natalie, etc., is indeed a chain of directed edges from those nodes to Donna (i.e., each node has a directed edge to the next node, eventually to Donna). So those nodes are ancestors of Donna in the directed sense. But we need to check if Donald appears in that chain. In the chain we traced backwards from Donna, we eventually reached Donald? Let's see: After Bradley, we had Donald (since Donald is ancestor of Bradley). Actually, we need to check the direction: The chain we traced backwards from Donna included \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So we have edge Donald -> Bradley. So Donald is ancestor of Bradley. Since we traced from Donna to Bradley (by following reverse edges), we then went to Donald because Donald is ancestor of Bradley (i.e., there is a directed edge from Donald to Bradley). But we need to confirm: The reverse of that edge is from Bradley to Donald (i.e., we can go from Bradley to Donald by following reverse direction). But in the forward direction, Donald -> Bradley. So moving from Bradley to Donald is moving opposite direction of the edge (i.e., backward). So in the reverse traversal, we go from Bradley to Donald (which is moving backward). So Donald appears in the reverse chain, but not as an ancestor of Donna in the forward sense. Because to be an ancestor of Donna, there must be a directed path from Donald to Donna. But we have no such path: Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene. No path to Donna.\n\nThus the ancestors of Donna are those nodes that have directed paths to Donna, not those that can be reached by reverse traversal from Donna. The reverse traversal from Donna to a node does not guarantee that the node is an ancestor of Donna; it only guarantees that the node is reachable by following reverse edges (i.e., there is a path from the node to Donna in the forward direction? Actually, if we go from Donna to a node via reverse edges, that means there is a forward edge from that node to the previous node. So if we go Donna -> Alexis (reverse), we have edge Alexis -> Donna in forward direction. So Alexis is ancestor of Donna. Then we go from Alexis to Sara (reverse), we have edge Sara -> Alexis in forward direction, so Sara is ancestor of Alexis, and thus ancestor of Donna. So each step in the reverse traversal corresponds to a forward edge from the node to the previous node. So indeed, each node we encounter in the reverse traversal is an ancestor of Donna. So we need to verify that for each step, there is a forward edge from the new node to the previous node. For the step from Bradley to Donald, we have forward edge Donald -> Bradley (Donald ancestor of Bradley). So Donald is ancestor of Bradley. Since Bradley is an ancestor of Donna? Wait, is Bradley an ancestor of Donna? Let's check: In the reverse traversal, we have Donna -> ... -> Bradley (by reverse edges). That means there is a forward path from Bradley to Donna? Actually, if we go from Donna to Bradley via reverse edges, we need to verify that each reverse step corresponds to a forward edge from the new node to the previous node. Let's check the steps:\n\n- Starting from Donna, we go to Alexis: forward edge Alexis -> Donna.\n\n- Then we go to Sara: forward edge Sara -> Alexis.\n\n- Then we go to Natalie: forward edge Natalie -> Sara.\n\n- Then we go to Ethan: forward edge Ethan -> Natalie.\n\n- Then we go to Danielle: forward edge Danielle -> Ethan.\n\n- Then we go to Lori: forward edge Lori -> Danielle.\n\n- Then we go to Diane: forward edge Diane -> Lori.\n\n- Then we go to Jerry: forward edge Jerry -> Diane.\n\n- Then we go to Shirley: forward edge Shirley -> Jerry.\n\n- Then we go to Albert: forward edge Albert -> Shirley.\n\n- Then we go to Janice: forward edge Janice -> Albert.\n\n- Then we go to Abigail: forward edge Abigail -> Janice.\n\n- Then we go to Raymond: forward edge Raymond -> Abigail.\n\n- Then we go to Bruce: forward edge Bruce -> Raymond.\n\n- Then we go to Katherine: forward edge Katherine -> Bruce.\n\n- Then we go to John: forward edge John -> Katherine.\n\n- Then we go to Diana: forward edge Diana -> John.\n\n- Then we go to Julia: forward edge Julia -> Diana.\n\n- Then we go to Andrew: forward edge Andrew -> Julia.\n\n- Then we go to Michael: forward edge Michael -> Andrew.\n\n- Then we go to Barbara: forward edge Barbara -> Michael.\n\n- Then we go to Ronald: forward edge Ronald -> Barbara.\n\n- Then we go to Brenda: forward edge Brenda -> Ronald.\n\n- Then we go to Jason: forward edge Jason -> Brenda.\n\n- Then we go to Margaret: forward edge Margaret -> Jason.\n\n- Then we go to Wayne: forward edge Wayne -> Margaret.\n\n- Then we go to Zachary: forward edge Zachary -> Wayne.\n\n- Then we go to Harold: forward edge Harold -> Zachary.\n\n- Then we go to Christian: forward edge Christian -> Harold.\n\n- Then we go to Kayla: forward edge Kayla -> Christian.\n\n- Then we go to Thomas: forward edge Thomas -> Kayla.\n\n- Then we go to Richard: forward edge Richard -> Thomas.\n\n- Then we go to Kelly: forward edge Kelly -> Richard.\n\n- Then we go to George: forward edge George -> Kelly.\n\n- Then we go to Mark: forward edge Mark -> George.\n\n- Then we go to Julie: forward edge Julie -> Mark.\n\n- Then we go to Henry: forward edge Henry -> Julie.\n\n- Then we go to Joyce: forward edge Joyce -> Henry.\n\n- Then we go to Gary: forward edge Gary -> Joyce.\n\n- Then we go to Jacob: forward edge Jacob -> Gary.\n\n- Then we go to Brian: forward edge Brian -> Jacob.\n\n- Then we go to Victoria: forward edge Victoria -> Brian.\n\n- Then we go to Eric: forward edge Eric -> Victoria.\n\n- Then we go to Russell: forward edge Russell -> Eric.\n\n- Then we go to Rachel: forward edge Rachel -> Russell.\n\n- Then we go to Jack: forward edge Jack -> Rachel.\n\n- Then we go to Jeffrey: forward edge Jeffrey -> Jack.\n\n- Then we go to Evelyn: forward edge Evelyn -> Jeffrey.\n\n- Then we go to Teresa: forward edge Teresa -> Evelyn.\n\n- Then we go to Lawrence: forward edge Lawrence -> Teresa.\n\n- Then we go to Michelle: forward edge Michelle -> Lawrence.\n\n- Then we go to Joshua: forward edge Joshua -> Michelle.\n\n- Then we go to Kimberly: forward edge Kimberly -> Joshua.\n\n- Then we go to Gerald: forward edge Gerald -> Kimberly.\n\n- Then we go to Karen: forward edge Karen -> Gerald.\n\n- Then we go to Joe: forward edge Joe -> Karen.\n\n- Then we go to Keith: forward edge Keith -> Joe.\n\n- Then we go to Samuel: forward edge Samuel -> Keith.\n\n- Then we go to Paul: forward edge Paul -> Samuel.\n\n- Then we go to Carolyn: forward edge Carolyn -> Paul.\n\n- Then we go to Donald: forward edge Donald -> Carolyn.\n\n- Then we go to Bradley: forward edge Bradley -> Donald? Wait, we need to check the direction: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" So Donald is ancestor of Bradley, meaning edge Donald -> Bradley. So forward edge from Donald to Bradley. So moving from Donald to Bradley is forward direction. So the reverse step from Bradley to Donald is backward direction (i.e., we are moving opposite to the forward edge). So the step from Donald to Bradley is forward, but the reverse step from Bradley to Donald is moving opposite to the forward edge. However, we need to see if the chain we wrote includes \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" In the reverse traversal we wrote, we went from Donald to Bradley (i.e., from Donald to Bradley). That is forward direction. Wait, we need to re-evaluate the reverse chain.\n\nThe reverse chain we wrote earlier was:\n\nDonna -> Alexis -> Sara -> Natalie -> Ethan -> Danielle -> Lori -> Diane -> Jerry -> Shirley -> Albert -> Janice -> Abigail -> Raymond -> Bruce -> Katherine -> John -> Diana -> Julia -> Andrew -> Michael -> Barbara -> Ronald -> Brenda -> Jason -> Margaret -> Wayne -> Zachary -> Harold -> Christian -> Kayla -> Thomas -> Richard -> Kelly -> George -> Mark -> Julie -> Henry -> Joyce -> Gary -> Jacob -> Brian -> Victoria -> Eric -> Russell -> Rachel -> Jack -> Jeffrey -> Evelyn -> Teresa -> Lawrence -> Michelle -> Joshua -> Kimberly -> Gerald -> Karen -> Joe -> Keith -> Samuel -> Paul -> Carolyn -> Donald -> Bradley -> Eugene.\n\nNow, the direction of each arrow in this chain is reversed relative to the forward edges: For each step from X to Y, we have forward edge from Y to X. For example, from Donna to Alexis, forward edge is Alexis -> Donna. So moving from Donna to Alexis is reverse of forward edge. So the chain we wrote is a reverse traversal (i.e., moving against the direction of edges). So the chain is a path in the undirected graph (i.e., each pair is directly related). So the chain is not a directed path; it's a path that goes up and down relative to the directed edges.\n\nThus the ancestors of Donna are those nodes reachable via reverse traversal from Donna, but not necessarily all of them have a directed path to Donna; they only have a directed path to the previous node in the chain, which eventually leads to Donna. Actually, each node in the reverse chain does have a directed path to Donna: Because each step from X to Y in the reverse chain corresponds to a forward edge from Y to X. So the forward path from Y to Donna goes through X? Let's think: Suppose we have reverse chain Donna <- Alexis <- Sara <- ... <- Eugene. The forward edges are: Alexis -> Donna, Sara -> Alexis, ... , Eugene? Actually, we need to check the forward direction for the final step: Eugene -> ??? We have \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\" So forward edge is Bradley -> Eugene. So the reverse step from Eugene to Bradley corresponds to forward edge Bradley -> Eugene. So the forward path from Bradley to Eugene goes to Eugene. But we need a forward path from Bradley to Donna: we need to see if there is a forward path from Bradley to Donna. Starting from Bradley, we have forward edge Bradley -> Eugene. That goes to Eugene, not to Donna. So Bradley does not have a forward path to Donna. So Bradley is not an ancestor of Donna in the directed sense. But the reverse chain includes Bradley because we reversed the direction of edges. However, the forward path from Bradley to Donna is not present; instead, we have a forward path from Bradley to Eugene, not to Donna. So Bradley is not an ancestor of Donna. So the ancestors of Donna are only those nodes that have a directed path to Donna. Let's compute the ancestors of Donna properly.\n\nWe have the directed edges list. Let's compute the ancestors of Donna by performing a reverse BFS (i.e., starting from Donna and moving backwards along incoming edges). Actually, the ancestors of Donna are those nodes from which there is a directed path to Donna (i.e., reachable in reverse direction). So we can compute ancestors by following incoming edges (reverse edges). Starting from Donna, we can go to its parents (incoming edges). We have only one incoming edge: Alexis -> Donna. So Alexis is a direct ancestor. Then from Alexis, we can go to its parents: Sara -> Alexis. So Sara is an ancestor. Then from Sara, its parents: Natalie -> Sara. So Natalie is ancestor. Continue: Ethan -> Natalie. So Ethan ancestor. Danielle -> Ethan. So Danielle ancestor. Lori -> Danielle. So Lori ancestor. Diane -> Lori. So Diane ancestor. Jerry -> Diane. So Jerry ancestor. Shirley -> Jerry. So Shirley ancestor. Albert -> Shirley. So Albert ancestor. Janice -> Albert. So Janice ancestor. Abigail -> Janice. So Abigail ancestor. Raymond -> Abigail. So Raymond ancestor. Bruce -> Raymond. So Bruce ancestor. Katherine -> Bruce. So Katherine ancestor. John -> Katherine. So John ancestor. Diana -> John. So Diana ancestor. Julia -> Diana. So Julia ancestor. Andrew -> Julia. So Andrew ancestor. Michael -> Andrew. So Michael ancestor. Barbara -> Michael. So Barbara ancestor. Ronald -> Barbara. So Ronald ancestor. Brenda -> Ronald. So Brenda ancestor. Jason -> Brenda. So Jason ancestor. Margaret -> Jason. So Margaret ancestor. Wayne -> Margaret. So Wayne ancestor. Zachary -> Wayne. So Zachary ancestor. Harold -> Zachary. So Harold ancestor. Christian -> Harold. So Christian ancestor. Kayla -> Christian. So Kayla ancestor. Thomas -> Kayla. So Thomas ancestor. Richard -> Thomas. So Richard ancestor. Kelly -> Richard. So Kelly ancestor. George -> Kelly. So George ancestor. Mark -> George. So Mark ancestor. Julie -> Mark. So Julie ancestor. Henry -> Julie. So Henry ancestor. Joyce -> Henry. So Joyce ancestor. Gary -> Joyce. So Gary ancestor. Jacob -> Gary. So Jacob ancestor. Brian -> Jacob. So Brian ancestor. Victoria -> Brian. So Victoria ancestor. Eric -> Victoria. So Eric ancestor. Russell -> Eric. So Russell ancestor. Rachel -> Russell. So Rachel ancestor. Jack -> Rachel. So Jack ancestor. Jeffrey -> Jack. So Jeffrey ancestor. Evelyn -> Jeffrey. So Evelyn ancestor. Teresa -> Evelyn. So Teresa ancestor. Lawrence -> Teresa. So Lawrence ancestor. Michelle -> Lawrence. So Michelle ancestor. Joshua -> Michelle. So Joshua ancestor. Kimberly -> Joshua. So Kimberly ancestor. Gerald -> Kimberly. So Gerald ancestor. Karen -> Gerald. So Karen ancestor. Joe -> Karen. So Joe ancestor. Keith -> Joe. So Keith ancestor. Samuel -> Keith. So Samuel ancestor. Paul -> Samuel. So Paul ancestor. Carolyn -> Paul. So Carolyn ancestor. Donald -> Carolyn. So Donald ancestor. Bradley -> Donald. So Bradley ancestor. Eugene? Wait, Bradley -> Donald is forward edge from Bradley to Donald. So the incoming edges to Bradley are from ??? Actually, we need to check the incoming edges to Bradley. The statement \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" means Donald -> Bradley (Donald is ancestor of Bradley). So the incoming edge to Bradley is from Donald. So Bradley's parent is Donald. So there is an incoming edge from Donald to Bradley. So the reverse traversal from Bradley goes to Donald (as we have). So Donald is ancestor of Bradley, and thus ancestor of Donna.\n\nNow, from Bradley, we need to check if there is any other incoming edge besides from Donald. Let's see: \"Donald is Bradley's ancestor.\" That's the only statement where Bradley appears as descendant. Also \"Bradley is Eugene's ancestor.\""}]}}],"usage":{"total_tokens":33339,"total_characters":0,"prompt_tokens":571,"completion_tokens":32768,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":32960}}}
