The task: Determine the lineage relationship between Madison and Shirley. There are multiple statements: e.g., \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" So Madison is an ancestor of Harold. Also \"Jordan is Harold's descendant.\" So Jordan is descendant of Harold, i.e., Harold is ancestor of Jordan. So we can chain: Madison -> (Harold) -> (Jordan). Also \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\" So Jordan is ancestor of Noah. Then \"Timothy is Noah's descendant.\" So Noah is ancestor of Timothy? Actually \"Timothy is Noah's descendant\" means Timothy is descendant of Noah, i.e., Noah is ancestor of Timothy. So we have: Jordan is ancestor of Noah, and Noah is ancestor of Timothy. So Jordan is also ancestor of Timothy (direct or indirect). Also \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant.\" So Matthew is descendant of Timothy, i.e., Timothy is ancestor of Matthew. So Jordan is also ancestor of Matthew.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nWe have a bunch of statements; we need to deduce relationship between Madison and Shirley. Potential relationships: ancestor, descendant, share a common ancestor, share a common descendant, none.\n\nWe need to parse all statements and construct the genealogical graph (maybe directed graph of \"is ancestor of\" relationships). Then find the relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nGiven the complexity (70+ statements), we need to systematically parse.\n\nDefine a relation: A is ancestor of B means there is a path from A to B following \"is ancestor of\" edges. A is descendant of B means B is ancestor of A. The statements provide direct ancestor/descendant relationships (i.e., immediate). But the graph can be transitive; we need to find any path.\n\nGoal: Determine if Madison is ancestor of Shirley, descendant of Shirley, they share a common ancestor, share a common descendant, or none.\n\nWe'll need to compute all reachable relationships. But given many statements, may be possible that they share a common ancestor, i.e., both are descendants of some person; also they could share a common descendant (someone is descendant of both). Or one is ancestor/descendant of the other. Or none.\n\nThus need to compute all relationships. Could be an answer like \"Madison and Shirley share a common ancestor.\" Or \"Madison is Shirley's ancestor.\" Let's parse.\n\nFirst, list statements:\n\n* Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\n* Eugene is Samantha's ancestor.\n* Doris is Aaron's descendant.\n* Bryan is Patricia's descendant.\n* Jordan is Harold's descendant.\n* Timothy is Noah's descendant.\n* Joyce is Joan's descendant.\n* Scott is Sophia's descendant.\n* Brian is Karen's descendant.\n* Lawrence is Marie's ancestor.\n* Judy is Christina's ancestor.\n* Margaret is Daniel's descendant.\n* Harold is Madison's descendant.\n* Christina is Bradley's ancestor.\n* Barbara is Peter's descendant.\n* Jose is Alexander's ancestor.\n* Jose is Richard's descendant.\n* Austin is Rachel's descendant.\n* Bradley is Ralph's ancestor.\n* Marie is Joan's ancestor.\n* Douglas is Austin's descendant.\n* Richard is Doris's descendant.\n* Evelyn is Shirley's descendant.\n* Jack is Eugene's ancestor.\n* Terry is George's descendant.\n* Donald is Scott's descendant.\n* Amanda is Ryan's descendant.\n* Matthew is Timothy's descendant.\n* Aaron is Melissa's descendant.\n* Andrea is Arthur's ancestor.\n* Mary is Janet's ancestor.\n* Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\n* Rachel is Donald's descendant.\n* Arthur is Kenneth's descendant.\n* Alice is Douglas's descendant.\n* Dorothy is Katherine's descendant.\n* James is Mason's descendant.\n* James is Karen's ancestor.\n* Brandon is Anthony's ancestor.\n* Mason is Anthony's descendant.\n* Amanda is Kenneth's ancestor.\n* Katherine is Janet's descendant.\n* Brandon is Dorothy's descendant.\n* Jack is Ralph's descendant.\n* Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\n* Michelle is Betty's ancestor.\n* Charlotte is Carol's ancestor.\n* Elijah is Nicole's descendant.\n* Patricia is Carol's descendant.\n* Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\n* Hannah is Daniel's ancestor.\n* Alexander is Andrea's ancestor.\n* Matthew is Mary's ancestor.\n* Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\n* Barbara is Nicole's ancestor.\n* Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\n* Elijah is Kevin's ancestor.\n* George is Samantha's descendant.\n* Bryan is Ryan's ancestor.\n* Sophia is Kevin's descendant.\n* Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\n* Charlotte is Terry's descendant.\n* Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\n\nFirst, we need to decide what statements are direct ancestor relationships. For each statement, if X is Y's ancestor, then X -> Y (X is ancestor of Y). If X is Y's descendant, then Y is ancestor of X. So X <- Y (or Y -> X). Let's treat each as a directed edge from ancestor to descendant.\n\nWe'll parse each statement and assign edges accordingly.\n\nWe'll create a set of persons and edges.\n\nList all persons: We'll need to track many.\n\nLet's parse each statement.\n\n1.

Charlotte is Terry's descendant.\nTerry is ancestor of Charlotte. Edge: Terry -> Charlotte.\n\n63. Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\nEvelyn is ancestor of Theresa. Edge: Evelyn -> Theresa.\n\nWe need to check each again for correctness.\n\nNow we have a directed graph.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nLet's identify all edges involving Madison and Shirley.\n\n- Madison -> Harold (from statement 13)\n- Also, other statements: \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" is the same as Madison -> Harold. Already captured.\n\n- There may be other edges with Madison: \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" (already). \"Jordan is Harold's descendant\" means Harold -> Jordan. So Madison -> Harold -> Jordan.\n\n- \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\" means Jordan -> Noah.\n\n- \"Noah is Timothy's ancestor\" (Timothy is Noah's descendant). So Noah -> Timothy.\n\n- \"Timothy is Matthew's descendant\" (Timothy -> Matthew). So chain: Madison -> Harold -> Jordan -> Noah -> Timothy -> Matthew.\n\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" (Matthew -> Mary). So chain continues: Madison -> ... -> Mary.\n\n- \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\"? Wait, \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\" is same as Timothy -> Matthew (already). So consistent.\n\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" (Matthew -> Mary). So Matthew is ancestor of Mary.\n\n- \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\" is earlier. So we have both relationships: Timothy is ancestor of Matthew (Timothy -> Matthew) and Matthew is ancestor of Mary (Matthew -> Mary). So chain.\n\n- \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\" and \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" => Timothy -> Matthew -> Mary.\n\n- Also \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" is already captured.\n\n- \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\" is captured.\n\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" we have.\n\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" we have.\n\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" is included.\n\nNow \"Shirley\" appears only in \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" which is Shirley -> Evelyn.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" (Evelyn -> Theresa). Also \"Evelyn is Shirley descendant\" we have.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" we have.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\"? Actually \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" is Theresa -> Peter. Already captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" (Evelyn -> Theresa). So chain: Shirley -> Evelyn -> Theresa.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" (Theresa -> Peter). So Shirley -> Evelyn -> Theresa -> Peter.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" is reverse: Evelyn -> Theresa.\n\nNow \"Shirley\" also appears maybe elsewhere? Not in other statements.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nWe need to see if there is a directed path between Madison and Shirley (i.e., Madison is ancestor of Shirley) or reverse (Shirley is ancestor of Madison). Or they share a common ancestor (some node X such that both are descendants of X). Or share a common descendant (some node Y that is descendant of both). Or none.\n\nThus we need to compute ancestors/descendants.\n\nGiven the graph, we can compute reachability.\n\nFirst, list all nodes and edges. Let's compile the adjacency list.\n\nI'll maintain a mapping: node -> list of children (descendants). We'll also need reverse mapping for ancestors.\n\nDefine edges (ancestor -> descendant). We'll list all.\n\nEdges:\n\n1. Alice -> Michelle\n2. Eugene -> Samantha\n3. Aaron -> Doris\n4. Patricia -> Bryan\n5. Harold -> Jordan\n6. Noah -> Timothy\n7. Joan -> Joyce\n8. Sophia -> Scott\n9. Karen -> Brian\n10. Lawrence -> Marie\n11. Judy -> Christina\n12. Daniel -> Margaret\n13. Madison -> Harold\n14. Christina -> Bradley\n15. Peter -> Barbara\n16. Jose -> Alexander\n17. Richard -> Jose\n18. Rachel -> Austin\n19. Bradley -> Ralph\n20. Marie -> Joan\n21. Austin -> Douglas\n22. Doris -> Richard\n23. Shirley -> Evelyn\n24. Jack -> Eugene\n25. George -> Terry\n26. Scott -> Donald\n27. Ryan -> Amanda\n28. Timothy -> Matthew\n29. Melissa -> Aaron\n30. Andrea -> Arthur\n31. Mary -> Janet\n32. Betty -> Hannah\n33. Donald -> Rachel\n34. Kenneth -> Arthur\n35. Douglas -> Alice\n36. Katherine -> Dorothy\n37. Mason -> James\n38. James -> Karen\n39. Brandon -> Anthony\n40. Anthony -> Mason\n41. Amanda -> Kenneth\n42. Janet -> Katherine\n43. Dorothy -> Brandon\n44. Ralph -> Jack\n45. Theresa -> Peter\n46. Michelle -> Betty\n47. Charlotte -> Carol\n48. Nicole -> Elijah\n49. Carol -> Patricia\n50. Jordan -> Noah\n51. Hannah -> Daniel\n52. Alexander -> Andrea\n53. Matthew -> Mary\n54. Joyce -> Melissa\n55. Barbara -> Nicole\n56. Brian -> Lawrence\n57. Elijah -> Kevin\n58. Samantha -> George\n59. Bryan -> Ryan\n60. Kevin -> Sophia\n61. Margaret -> Judy\n62. Terry -> Charlotte\n63. Evelyn -> Theresa\n\nCheck each statement again for completeness:\n\n- \"Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\" Yes (Alice -> Michelle)\n- \"Eugene is Samantha's ancestor.\" (Eugene -> Samantha)\n- \"Doris is Aaron's descendant.\" (Aaron -> Doris)\n- \"Bryan is Patricia's descendant.\" (Patricia -> Bryan)\n- \"Jordan is Harold's descendant.\" (Harold -> Jordan)\n- \"Timothy is Noah's descendant.\" (Noah -> Timothy)\n- \"Joyce is Joan's descendant.\" (Joan -> Joyce)\n- \"Scott is Sophia's descendant.\" (Sophia -> Scott)\n- \"Brian is Karen's descendant.\" (Karen -> Brian)\n- \"Lawrence is Marie's ancestor.\" (Lawrence -> Marie)\n- \"Judy is Christina's ancestor.\" (Judy -> Christina)\n- \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant.\" (Daniel -> Margaret)\n- \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" (Madison -> Harold)\n- \"Christina is Bradley's ancestor.\" (Christina -> Bradley)\n- \"Barbara is Peter's descendant.\" (Peter -> Barbara)\n- \"Jose is Alexander's ancestor.\" (Jose -> Alexander)\n- \"Jose is Richard's descendant.\" (Richard -> Jose)\n- \"Austin is Rachel's descendant.\" (Rachel -> Austin)\n- \"Bradley is Ralph's ancestor.\" (Bradley -> Ralph)\n- \"Marie is Joan's ancestor.\" (Marie -> Joan)\n- \"Douglas is Austin's descendant.\" (Austin -> Douglas)\n- \"Richard is Doris's descendant.\" (Doris -> Richard)\n- \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant.\" (Shirley -> Evelyn)\n- \"Jack is Eugene's ancestor.\" (Jack -> Eugene)\n- \"Terry is George's descendant.\" (George -> Terry)\n- \"Donald is Scott's descendant.\" (Scott -> Donald)\n- \"Amanda is Ryan's descendant.\" (Ryan -> Amanda)\n- \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant.\" (Timothy -> Matthew)\n- \"Aaron is Melissa's descendant.\" (Melissa -> Aaron)\n- \"Andrea is Arthur's ancestor.\" (Andrea -> Arthur)\n- \"Mary is Janet's ancestor.\" (Mary -> Janet)\n- \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\" (Betty -> Hannah)\n- \"Rachel is Donald's descendant.\" (Donald -> Rachel)\n- \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant.\" (Kenneth -> Arthur)\n- \"Alice is Douglas's descendant.\" (Douglas -> Alice)\n- \"Dorothy is Katherine's descendant.\" (Katherine -> Dorothy)\n- \"James is Mason's descendant.\" (Mason -> James)\n- \"James is Karen's ancestor.\" (James -> Karen)\n- \"Brandon is Anthony's ancestor.\" (Brandon -> Anthony)\n- \"Mason is Anthony's descendant.\" (Anthony -> Mason)\n- \"Amanda is Kenneth's ancestor.\" (Amanda -> Kenneth)\n- \"Katherine is Janet's descendant.\" (Janet -> Katherine)\n- \"Brandon is Dorothy's descendant.\" (Dorothy -> Brandon)\n- \"Jack is Ralph's descendant.\" (Ralph -> Jack)\n- \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\" (Theresa -> Peter)\n- \"Michelle is Betty's ancestor.\" (Michelle -> Betty)\n- \"Charlotte is Carol's ancestor.\" (Charlotte -> Carol)\n- \"Elijah is Nicole's descendant.\" (Nicole -> Elijah)\n- \"Patricia is Carol's descendant.\" (Carol -> Patricia)\n- \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\" (Jordan -> Noah)\n- \"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor.\" (Hannah -> Daniel)\n- \"Alexander is Andrea's ancestor.\" (Alexander -> Andrea)\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor.\" (Matthew -> Mary)\n- \"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\" (Joyce -> Melissa)\n- \"Barbara is Nicole's ancestor.\" (Barbara -> Nicole)\n- \"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\" (Brian -> Lawrence)\n- \"Elijah is Kevin's ancestor.\" (Elijah -> Kevin)\n- \"George is Samantha's descendant.\" (Samantha -> George)\n- \"Bryan is Ryan's ancestor.\" (Bryan -> Ryan)\n- \"Sophia is Kevin's descendant.\" (Kevin -> Sophia)\n- \"Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\" (Margaret -> Judy)\n- \"Charlotte is Terry's descendant.\" (Terry -> Charlotte)\n- \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" (Evelyn -> Theresa)\n\nAll good.\n\nNow we need to compute reachability.\n\nGoal: Relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nFirst, compute all ancestors and descendants for Madison and Shirley.\n\nWe'll need to see if any path from Madison to Shirley (Madison is ancestor of Shirley) or from Shirley to Madison (Shirley is ancestor of Madison). Also if they share a common ancestor (i.e., there exists some X such that both are descendants of X). Or share a common descendant (there exists Y such that both are ancestors of Y). Or none.\n\nGiven the graph, we need to see connectivity.\n\nWe have many nodes, some may be disconnected.\n\nFirst, list all nodes (maybe 50+). Let's list them:\n\nAlice\nMichelle\nEugene\nSamantha\nDoris\nAaron\nBryan\nPatricia\nHarold\nJordan\nNoah\nTimothy\nJoyce\nJoan\nScott\nSophia\nBrian\nKaren\nLawrence\nMarie\nJudy\nChristina\nMargaret\nDaniel\nBradley\nPeter\nBarbara\nJose\nAlexander\nRichard\nAustin\nRachel\nBradley (already)\nRalph\nGeorge\nTerry\nDonald\nAmanda\nMatthew\nMelissa\nAaron (already)\nAndrea\nArthur\nMary\nJanet\nBetty\nHannah\nEvelyn\nJack\nDorothy\nKatherine\nJames\nMason\nAnthony\nBrandon\nElijah\nNicole\nKevin\nSamantha (already)\nTheresa\nCatherine? Actually \"Katherine\" appears.\nCharlotte\nCarol\nPatricia (already)\nHannah (already)\nMatthew (already)\nJoyce (already)\nBarbara (already)\nBrian (already)\nElijah (already)\nGeorge (already)\nBryan (already)\nSophia (already)\nMargaret (already)\nShirley\n\nWe have also \"Shirley\". Also \"Evelyn\" etc.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nFirst, we need to see if there is any path connecting them.\n\nLet's compute the ancestors/descendants for Madison.\n\nWe have direct descendant: Madison -> Harold.\n\nHarold -> Jordan (from Harold -> Jordan). Also Jordan -> Noah (Jordan -> Noah). Also Noah -> Timothy (Noah -> Timothy). Also Timothy -> Matthew (Timothy -> Matthew). Also Matthew -> Mary (Matthew -> Mary). Also Mary -> Janet (Mary -> Janet). Also Janet -> Katherine (Janet -> Katherine). Also Katherine -> Dorothy (Katherine -> Dorothy). Also Dorothy -> Brandon (Dorothy -> Brandon). Also Brandon -> Anthony (Brandon -> Anthony). Also Anthony -> Mason (Anthony -> Mason). Also Mason -> James (Mason -> James). Also James -> Karen (James -> Karen). Also Karen -> Brian (Karen -> Brian). Also Brian -> Lawrence (Brian -> Lawrence). Also Lawrence -> Marie (Lawrence -> Marie). Also Marie -> Joan (Marie -> Joan). Also Joan -> Joyce (Joan -> Joyce). Also Joyce -> Melissa (Joyce -> Melissa). Also Melissa -> Aaron (Melissa -> Aaron). Also Aaron -> Doris (Aaron -> Doris). Also Doris -> Richard (Doris -> Richard). Also Richard -> Jose (Richard -> Jose). Also Jose -> Alexander (Jose -> Alexander). Also Alexander -> Andrea (Alexander -> Andrea). Also Andrea -> Arthur (Andrea -> Arthur). Also Arthur -> Kenneth (Kenneth -> Arthur). Wait, check: we have Kenneth -> Arthur (Kenneth is ancestor of Arthur). Actually statement: \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant.\" So Kenneth -> Arthur. So from Arthur we need to go to ... Actually we have Arthur's descendants? Let's see: \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant.\" So Arthur is descendant of Kenneth. So we have edge: Kenneth -> Arthur. Does Arthur have any children? There is \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" and \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? No other statements about Arthur being ancestor of someone. Actually \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" is the only direct. There's also \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" (makes sense). There's also \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? Already.\n\nThere is \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" and also \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? Not needed.\n\nBut we also have \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" and \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? Already.\n\nAlso \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? Already.\n\nBut also \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? Ok.\n\nNow, we have \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\", meaning Kenneth is ancestor of Arthur. Also \"Andrea is Arthur's ancestor\". So Andrea -> Arthur. That is a direct edge. So we have Andrea -> Arthur.\n\nThus from Arthur we can go to ... any child edges? Let's see if Arthur appears as ancestor in any statements: \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant.\" That's it. \"Andrea is Arthur's ancestor.\" That's a reverse relationship (Andrea -> Arthur). \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" is the only one. No statements about Arthur being ancestor of someone else. So Arthur has no outgoing edges (no children). So chain stops.\n\nThus the path from Madison down to Arthur ends at Arthur (no further children). But there may be other branches.\n\nBut also there is \"Andrew\"? Not present.\n\nNow, also we have \"Madison -> Harold -> Jordan -> Noah -> Timothy -> Matthew -> Mary -> Janet -> Katherine -> Dorothy -> Brandon -> Anthony -> Mason -> James -> Karen -> Brian -> Lawrence -> Marie -> Joan -> Joyce -> Melissa -> Aaron -> Doris -> Richard -> Jose -> Alexander -> Andrea -> Arthur. That's a long chain.\n\nBut there may be branching earlier: e.g., from Harold we also have \"Harold -> Jordan\". Already in chain. Also \"Harold -> Jordan\"? That's the only child of Harold. Also \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" is the only child of Madison.\n\nFrom Jordan we have \"Jordan -> Noah\". Also \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\" which we already have. Also \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\" is same direction. Also \"Jordan is Harold's descendant\" we have. Also \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\". So Jordan has child Noah.\n\nFrom Noah we have \"Noah -> Timothy\". Also \"Timothy is Noah's descendant\" we have.\n\nFrom Timothy we have \"Timothy -> Matthew\". Also \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\". So only child.\n\nFrom Matthew we have \"Matthew -> Mary\". Also \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\". So child Mary.\n\nFrom Mary we have \"Mary -> Janet\". Also \"Mary is Janet's ancestor\". So child Janet.\n\nFrom Janet we have \"Janet -> Katherine\". Also \"Katherine is Janet's descendant\". So child Katherine.\n\nFrom Katherine we have \"Katherine -> Dorothy\". Also \"Katherine is Janet's descendant\". So child Dorothy.\n\nFrom Dorothy we have \"Dorothy -> Brandon\". Also \"Brandon is Dorothy's descendant\". So child Brandon.\n\nFrom Brandon we have \"Brandon -> Anthony\". Also \"Brandon is Anthony's ancestor\". So child Anthony.\n\nFrom Anthony we have \"Anthony -> Mason\". Also \"Mason is Anthony's descendant\". So child Mason.\n\nFrom Mason we have \"Mason -> James\". Also \"Mason is Anthony's descendant\"? Actually \"Mason is Anthony's descendant\" is the same direction. So child James.\n\nFrom James we have \"James -> Karen\". Also \"James is Karen's ancestor\". So child Karen.\n\nFrom Karen we have \"Karen -> Brian\". Also \"Karen is Brian's ancestor\". So child Brian.\n\nFrom Brian we have \"Brian -> Lawrence\". Also \"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor\". So child Lawrence.\n\nFrom Lawrence we have \"Lawrence -> Marie\". So child Marie.\n\nFrom Marie we have \"Marie -> Joan\". So child Joan.\n\nFrom Joan we have \"Joan -> Joyce\". So child Joyce.\n\nFrom Joyce we have \"Joyce -> Melissa\". So child Melissa.\n\nFrom Melissa we have \"Melissa -> Aaron\". So child Aaron.\n\nFrom Aaron we have \"Aaron -> Doris\". So child Doris.\n\nFrom Doris we have \"Doris -> Richard\". So child Richard.\n\nFrom Richard we have \"Richard -> Jose\". So child Jose.\n\nFrom Jose we have \"Jose -> Alexander\". So child Alexander.\n\nFrom Alexander we have \"Alexander -> Andrea\". So child Andrea.\n\nFrom Andrea we have \"Andrea -> Arthur\". So child Arthur.\n\nArthur has no children.\n\nThus the chain from Madison goes down to Arthur.\n\nThus all nodes in this chain are descendants of Madison.\n\nThus Madison's descendants include: Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa, Aaron, Doris, Richard, Jose, Alexander, Andrea, Arthur. Also includes many others indirectly via branching? Actually this chain includes all nodes that are reachable from Madison via the directed graph. There might be branching at each node: each node may have other children besides the one in the chain. Let's check each node for other outgoing edges.\n\nCheck each node's adjacency list (list of children). We'll need to examine all edges for each node.\n\nLet's list all nodes with outgoing edges:\n\nAlice -> Michelle\n\nEugene -> Samantha\n\nAaron -> Doris\n\nPatricia -> Bryan\n\nHarold -> Jordan\n\nNoah -> Timothy\n\nJoan -> Joyce\n\nSophia -> Scott\n\nKaren -> Brian\n\nLawrence -> Marie\n\nJudy -> Christina\n\nDaniel -> Margaret\n\nMadison -> Harold\n\nChristina -> Bradley\n\nPeter -> Barbara\n\nJose -> Alexander\n\nRichard -> Jose\n\nRachel -> Austin\n\nBradley -> Ralph\n\nMarie -> Joan\n\nAustin -> Douglas\n\nDoris -> Richard\n\nShirley -> Evelyn\n\nJack -> Eugene\n\nGeorge -> Terry\n\nScott -> Donald\n\nRyan -> Amanda\n\nTimothy -> Matthew\n\nMelissa -> Aaron\n\nAndrea -> Arthur\n\nMary -> Janet\n\nBetty -> Hannah\n\nDonald -> Rachel\n\nKenneth -> Arthur\n\nDouglas -> Alice\n\nKatherine -> Dorothy\n\nMason -> James\n\nJames -> Karen\n\nBrandon -> Anthony\n\nAnthony -> Mason\n\nAmanda -> Kenneth\n\nJanet -> Katherine\n\nDorothy -> Brandon\n\nRalph -> Jack\n\nTheresa -> Peter\n\nMichelle -> Betty\n\nCharlotte -> Carol\n\nNicole -> Elijah\n\nCarol -> Patricia\n\nJordan -> Noah\n\nHannah -> Daniel\n\nAlexander -> Andrea\n\nMatthew -> Mary\n\nJoyce -> Melissa\n\nBarbara -> Nicole\n\nBrian -> Lawrence\n\nElijah -> Kevin\n\nSamantha -> George\n\nBryan -> Ryan\n\nKevin -> Sophia\n\nMargaret -> Judy\n\nTerry -> Charlotte\n\nEvelyn -> Theresa\n\nAlso \"Evelyn -> Theresa\" we have.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" is same direction (Evelyn -> Theresa). Already captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" (Theresa -> Peter). Already captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" we have.\n\nNow \"Evelyn is Shirley descendant\" (Shirley -> Evelyn). Already.\n\nNow \"Shirley -> Evelyn\". Already.\n\nNow \"Evelyn -> Theresa\". Already.\n\nNow \"Theresa -> Peter\". Already.\n\nNow \"Peter -> Barbara\". Already.\n\nNow \"Barbara -> Nicole\". Already.\n\nNow \"Nicole -> Elijah\". Already.\n\nNow \"Elijah -> Kevin\". Already.\n\nNow \"Kevin -> Sophia\". Already.\n\nNow \"Sophia -> Scott\". Already.\n\nNow \"Scott -> Donald\". Already.\n\nNow \"Donald -> Rachel\". Already.\n\nNow \"Rachel -> Austin\". Already.\n\nNow \"Austin -> Douglas\". Already.\n\nNow \"Douglas -> Alice\". Already.\n\nNow \"Alice -> Michelle\". Already.\n\nNow \"Michelle -> Betty\". Already.\n\nNow \"Betty -> Hannah\". Already.\n\nNow \"Hannah -> Daniel\". Already.\n\nNow \"Daniel -> Margaret\". Already.\n\nNow \"Margaret -> Judy\". Already.\n\nNow \"Judy -> Christina\". Already.\n\nNow \"Christina -> Bradley\". Already.\n\nNow \"Bradley -> Ralph\". Already.\n\nNow \"Ralph -> Jack\". Already.\n\nNow \"Jack -> Eugene\". Already.\n\nNow \"Eugene -> Samantha\". Already.\n\nNow \"Samantha -> George\". Already.\n\nNow \"George -> Terry\". Already.\n\nNow \"Terry -> Charlotte\". Already.\n\nNow \"Charlotte -> Carol\". Already.\n\nNow \"Carol -> Patricia\". Already.\n\nNow \"Patricia -> Bryan\". Already.\n\nNow \"Bryan -> Ryan\". Already.\n\nNow \"Ryan -> Amanda\". Already.\n\nNow \"Amanda -> Kenneth\". Already.\n\nNow \"Kenneth -> Arthur\". Already.\n\nNow \"Arthur -> (none)\". So chain ends.\n\nNow also \"Evelyn -> Theresa\" is part of that chain.\n\nNow \"Theresa -> Peter\" is also part.\n\nThus the graph appears to be a single large directed tree (or DAG) with many nodes. It seems all nodes are connected in a single chain from Madison to Arthur and then also from Shirley to Evelyn to Theresa to Peter to Barbara to Nicole to Elijah to Kevin to Sophia to Scott to Donald to Rachel to Austin to Douglas to Alice to Michelle to Betty to Hannah to Daniel to Margaret to Judy to Christina to Bradley to Ralph to Jack to Eugene to Samantha to George to Terry to Charlotte to Carol to Patricia to Bryan to Ryan to Amanda to Kenneth to Arthur. Actually we need to check if there are any cycles or branching.\n\nWe see that there is a chain from Madison all the way down to Arthur (through many nodes). Then from Arthur, there is no further children. However, we also have the chain from Shirley to Evelyn to Theresa to Peter to Barbara to Nicole to Elijah to Kevin to Sophia to Scott to Donald to Rachel to Austin to Douglas to Alice to Michelle to Betty to Hannah to Daniel to Margaret to Judy to Christina to Bradley to Ralph to Jack to Eugene to Samantha to George to Terry to Charlotte to Carol to Patricia to Bryan to Ryan to Amanda to Kenneth to Arthur. Wait, note that we already have Arthur as a node in both chains: one from Madison to Arthur, and also the chain from Shirley passes through Arthur at the end. Indeed, the chain from Shirley goes: Shirley -> Evelyn -> Theresa -> Peter -> Barbara -> Nicole -> Elijah -> Kevin -> Sophia -> Scott -> Donald -> Rachel -> Austin -> Douglas -> Alice -> Michelle -> Betty -> Hannah -> Daniel -> Margaret -> Judy -> Christina -> Bradley -> Ralph -> Jack -> Eugene -> Samantha -> George -> Terry -> Charlotte -> Carol -> Patricia -> Bryan -> Ryan -> Amanda -> Kenneth -> Arthur. So this chain ends at Arthur, which is also a descendant of Madison.\n\nThus we have a path from Madison to Arthur, and from Shirley to Arthur (through the chain). Actually from Shirley to Arthur is a path: Shirley -> Evelyn -> ... -> Arthur. And from Madison to Arthur is also a path: Madison -> ... -> Arthur. So both Madison and Shirley are ancestors of Arthur (or rather, they are ancestors of Arthur). Wait, careful: In the graph, edges go from ancestor to descendant. So if we have a path from Madison to Arthur, that means Madison is ancestor of Arthur. If we have a path from Shirley to Arthur, that means Shirley is ancestor of Arthur. So both Madison and Shirley are ancestors of Arthur. So they share a common descendant (Arthur). But the question asks for relationship between Madison and Shirley: do they share a common ancestor, a common descendant, is one ancestor of the other, etc.\n\nFrom the graph, we see that there is a path from Madison to Arthur (so Madison is ancestor of Arthur). There is also a path from Shirley to Arthur (so Shirley is ancestor of Arthur). Thus they share a common descendant (Arthur). However, we need to check if there are any other connections.\n\nBut also, there might be a path from Madison to Shirley or from Shirley to Madison. Let's examine.\n\nFrom Madison, we have a chain down to Arthur. Does this chain include Shirley? No. The chain from Madison includes nodes: Madison, Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa, Aaron, Doris, Richard, Jose, Alexander, Andrea, Arthur. Does it include Shirley? No. Does it include Evelyn? No. Does it include any of the chain from Shirley? Let's check if any of those nodes appear in both chains.\n\nChain from Madison: we have Madison, Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa, Aaron, Doris, Richard, Jose, Alexander, Andrea, Arthur.\n\nChain from Shirley: Shirley, Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George, Terry, Charlotte, Carol, Patricia, Bryan, Ryan, Amanda, Kenneth, Arthur.\n\nThus the only overlapping node is Arthur. Indeed, Arthur appears at the end of both chains. So they share a common descendant (Arthur). But they also share a common ancestor? Let's check if there is any node that is ancestor of both Madison and Shirley. Does any node have a path to both? Possibly there could be a node that is an ancestor of both Madison and Shirley, meaning there is a path from that node to Madison and also to Shirley. But we need to see if any node appears above both Madison and Shirley in the graph.\n\nFrom the edges, we have no edges pointing to Madison (no statements like \"X is Madison's ancestor\" or \"X is Madison's descendant\"? Actually we have \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" which is Madison -> Harold. So Madison is the root of its chain. There is no edge into Madison (i.e., no one is ancestor of Madison). So Madison is a root.\n\nSimilarly, Shirley has no incoming edges (no statement like \"X is Shirley ancestor\" or \"X is Shirley descendant\"? Actually \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" means Shirley -> Evelyn. So Shirley is root of its chain. No incoming edges.\n\nThus Madison and Shirley are both roots of separate trees that eventually converge at Arthur (common descendant). So they share a common descendant (Arthur). They do not share a common ancestor (since they are roots). Also, there is no path from Madison to Shirley (i.e., Madison is not ancestor of Shirley) because there is no path from Madison to any of the nodes in Shirley's chain except Arthur (which is at the bottom). But to be ancestor of Shirley, there would need to be a path from Madison to Shirley. Does Madison have a path to Shirley? Let's see: Madison -> ... -> Arthur. Does Arthur have a child? No. So no path to Shirley. So not ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, Shirley is not ancestor of Madison, because no path from Shirley to Madison.\n\nThus the relationship is: Madison and Shirley share a common descendant (Arthur). Also they share a common descendant maybe more than one? Possibly also share other common descendants like maybe some other node that is reachable from both. Let's check if any other node is reachable from both. The only overlapping node is Arthur, because the two trees converge at Arthur. There might be other nodes reachable from both if there are other connections after Arthur, but Arthur has no children. So the only common descendant is Arthur.\n\nThus answer: \"Madison and Shirley share a common descendant.\" That corresponds to option 4: \"Madison and Shirley share a common descendant.\"\n\nThus answer: <ANSWER>4</ANSWER>.\n\nBut before finalizing, we need to double-check the graph for any potential alternative paths that could cause Madison to be ancestor of Shirley or vice versa. Also check if there might be a path from Madison to Shirley via some other node besides Arthur, perhaps via a different branch that merges earlier. But the graph seems to be a single directed tree merging at Arthur. But we need to verify all edges for any cross-connections.\n\nLet's systematically compute the graph and find all reachable nodes from each root.\n\nWe'll parse all edges again and see if any node appears in both subtrees besides Arthur.\n\nFirst, list all nodes and edges again. Then identify root nodes (nodes with no incoming edges). Then see which nodes are reachable from each root.\n\nWe have root nodes: nodes with no incoming edges (i.e., not appearing as descendant in any statement). Let's find them.\n\nFrom edges list, we can find all nodes that appear as destination (descendant) in any edge. Let's compile all destinations:\n\nFrom edges:\n\nAlice -> Michelle (destination: Michelle)\nEugene -> Samantha (destination: Samantha)\nAaron -> Doris (dest: Doris)\nPatricia -> Bryan (dest: Bryan)\nHarold -> Jordan (dest: Jordan)\nNoah -> Timothy (dest: Timothy)\nJoan -> Joyce (dest: Joyce)\nSophia -> Scott (dest: Scott)\nKaren -> Brian (dest: Brian)\nLawrence -> Marie (dest: Marie)\nJudy -> Christina (dest: Christina)\nDaniel -> Margaret (dest: Margaret)\nMadison -> Harold (dest: Harold)\nChristina -> Bradley (dest: Bradley)\nPeter -> Barbara (dest: Barbara)\nJose -> Alexander (dest: Alexander)\nRichard -> Jose (dest: Jose)\nRachel -> Austin (dest: Austin)\nBradley -> Ralph (dest: Ralph)\nMarie -> Joan (dest: Joan)\nAustin -> Douglas (dest: Douglas)\nDoris -> Richard (dest: Richard)\nShirley -> Evelyn (dest: Evelyn)\nJack -> Eugene (dest: Eugene)\nGeorge -> Terry (dest: Terry)\nScott -> Donald (dest: Donald)\nRyan -> Amanda (dest: Amanda)\nTimothy -> Matthew (dest: Matthew)\nMelissa -> Aaron (dest: Aaron)\nAndrea -> Arthur (dest: Arthur)\nMary -> Janet (dest: Janet)\nBetty -> Hannah (dest: Hannah)\nDonald -> Rachel (dest: Rachel)\nKenneth -> Arthur (dest: Arthur)\nDouglas -> Alice (dest: Alice)\nKatherine -> Dorothy (dest: Dorothy)\nMason -> James (dest: James)\nJames -> Karen (dest: Karen)\nBrandon -> Anthony (dest: Anthony)\nAnthony -> Mason (dest: Mason)\nAmanda -> Kenneth (dest: Kenneth)\nJanet -> Katherine (dest: Katherine)\nDorothy -> Brandon (dest: Brandon)\nRalph -> Jack (dest: Jack)\nTheresa -> Peter (dest: Peter)\nMichelle -> Betty (dest: Betty)\nCharlotte -> Carol (dest: Carol)\nNicole -> Elijah (dest: Elijah)\nCarol -> Patricia (dest: Patricia)\nJordan -> Noah (dest: Noah)\nHannah -> Daniel (dest: Daniel)\nAlexander -> Andrea (dest: Andrea)\nMatthew -> Mary (dest: Mary)\nJoyce -> Melissa (dest: Melissa)\nBarbara -> Nicole (dest: Nicole)\nBrian -> Lawrence (dest: Lawrence)\nElijah -> Kevin (dest: Kevin)\nSamantha -> George (dest: George)\nBryan -> Ryan (dest: Ryan)\nKevin -> Sophia (dest: Sophia)\nMargaret -> Judy (dest: Judy)\nTerry -> Charlotte (dest: Charlotte)\nEvelyn -> Theresa (dest: Theresa)\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" is same direction (Evelyn -> Theresa). Already.\n\nThus all destinations (descendants) are: Michelle, Samantha, Doris, Bryan, Jordan, Timothy, Joyce, Scott, Brian, Marie, Christina, Margaret, Harold, Bradley, Barbara, Alexander, Jose, Austin, Ralph, Joan, Douglas, Richard, Evelyn, Eugene, Terry, Donald, Amanda, Matthew, Aaron, Arthur, Janet, Hannah, Rachel, Arthur (again), Alice, Dorothy, James, Karen, Anthony, Mason, Kenneth, Katherine, Brandon, Jack, Peter, Betty, Carol, Elijah, Patricia, Noah, Daniel, Andrea, Mary, Melissa, Nicole, Lawrence, Kevin, George, Ryan, Sophia, Judy, Charlotte, Theresa.\n\nNow we need to see which nodes are not in this destination list; those are roots (no incoming edges). Let's list all nodes that appear anywhere (both as source or destination). Then find those not in destination list.\n\nList all nodes that appear as source:\n\nAlice, Eugene, Aaron, Patricia, Harold, Noah, Joan, Sophia, Karen, Lawrence, Judy, Daniel, Madison, Christina, Peter, Jose, Richard, Rachel, Bradley, Marie, Austin, Doris, Shirley, Jack, George, Scott, Ryan, Timothy, Melissa, Andrea, Mary, Betty, Donald, Kenneth, Douglas, Katherine, Mason, James, Brandon, Anthony, Amanda, Janet, Dorothy, Ralph, Theresa, Michelle, Charlotte, Nicole, Carol, Jordan, Hannah, Alexander, Joyce, Barbara, Brian, Elijah, Samantha, Bryan, Kevin, Terry, Evelyn, (also maybe others: \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" already captured). Also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" is same direction.\n\nAlso \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" is same.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk enough.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nStop.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nStop.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow we have all nodes.\n\nNow find nodes that are not in destination list (i.e., no incoming edges). Let's list all nodes from source list:\n\n- Alice (source) appears also as destination (Douglas -> Alice). So Alice has incoming edge from Douglas. So not root.\n\n- Eugene (source) appears also as destination (Jack -> Eugene). So Eugene has incoming from Jack. Not root.\n\n- Aaron (source) appears also as destination (Melissa -> Aaron). So not root.\n\n- Patricia (source) appears also as destination (Carol -> Patricia). So not root.\n\n- Harold (source) appears also as destination (Madison -> Harold).

So not root.\n\n- Doris (source) appears also as destination (Aaron -> Doris). So not root.\n\n- Shirley (source) appears also as destination? No. So Shirley is a root (no incoming edges). Actually check: is there any statement where someone is \"Shirley's descendant\"? Yes: Evelyn is Shirley's descendant. That is Shirley -> Evelyn. So Evelyn is descendant of Shirley. But is there any statement like \"X is Shirley's ancestor\"? No. So Shirley has no incoming edges. So Shirley is a root.\n\n- Jack (source) appears also as destination (Ralph -> Jack).

Let's double-check if any other node appears as source but not as destination. Let's check each source again for being also a destination:\n\n- Alice (source) appears as destination (Douglas -> Alice). So not root.\n\n- Eugene appears as destination (Jack -> Eugene).

No. So root.\n\n- Jack appears as destination (Ralph -> Jack). Not root.\n\n- George appears as destination (Samantha -> George). Not root.\n\n- Scott appears as destination (Sophia -> Scott). Not root.\n\n- Ryan appears as destination (Bryan -> Ryan). Not root.\n\n- Timothy appears as destination (Noah -> Timothy). Not root.\n\n- Melissa appears as destination (Joyce -> Melissa).

Not root.\n\n- Donald appears as destination (Scott -> Donald). Not root.\n\n- Kenneth appears as destination (Amanda -> Kenneth). Not root.\n\n- Douglas appears as destination (Austin -> Douglas). Not root.\n\n- Katherine appears as destination (Janet -> Katherine). Not root.\n\n- Mason appears as destination (Anthony -> Mason). Not root.\n\n- James appears as destination (Mason -> James).

Not root.\n\n- Alexander appears as destination (Jose -> Alexander). Not root.\n\n- Joyce appears as destination (Joan -> Joyce). Not root.\n\n- Barbara appears as destination (Peter -> Barbara). Not root.\n\n- Brian appears as destination (Karen -> Brian). Not root.\n\n- Elijah appears as destination (Nicole -> Elijah). Not root.\n\n- Samantha appears as destination (Eugene -> Samantha). Not root.\n\n- Bryan appears as destination (Patricia -> Bryan). Not root.\n\n- Kevin appears as destination (Elijah -> Kevin). Not root.\n\n- Terry appears as destination (George -> Terry). Not root.\n\n- Evelyn appears as destination (Shirley -> Evelyn). Not root.\n\nThus indeed only Madison and Shirley have no incoming edges. So they are roots.\n\nNow the graph is a directed forest (actually a directed tree merging at Arthur). Let's verify that the graph is indeed a tree (no cycles). Check for cycles: Possibly there could be cycles like a node appears both as ancestor and descendant of itself indirectly. Let's check for potential cycles.\n\nWe have edges that could cause cycles: e.g., \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\", \"Alice -> Michelle\", \"Michelle -> Betty\", \"Betty -> Hannah\", \"Hannah -> Daniel\", \"Daniel -> Margaret\", \"Margaret -> Judy\", \"Judy -> Christina\", \"Christina -> Bradley\", \"Bradley -> Ralph\", \"Ralph -> Jack\", \"Jack -> Eugene\", \"Eugene -> Samantha\", \"Samantha -> George\", \"George -> Terry\", \"Terry -> Charlotte\", \"Charlotte -> Carol\", \"Carol -> Patricia\", \"Patricia -> Bryan\", \"Bryan -> Ryan\", \"Ryan -> Amanda\", \"Amanda -> Kenneth\", \"Kenneth -> Arthur\", \"Arthur -> (none)\". So that chain leads to Arthur.\n\nNow also \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\". Also \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\". \"Alice -> Michelle\". So chain continues.\n\nNow also \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\". \"Alice -> Michelle\". \"Michelle -> Betty\". \"Betty -> Hannah\". \"Hannah -> Daniel\". \"Daniel -> Margaret\". \"Margaret -> Judy\". \"Judy -> Christina\". \"Christina -> Bradley\". \"Bradley -> Ralph\". \"Ralph -> Jack\". \"Jack -> Eugene\". \"Eugene -> Samantha\". \"Samantha -> George\". \"George -> Terry\". \"Terry -> Charlotte\". \"Charlotte -> Carol\". \"Carol -> Patricia\". \"Patricia -> Bryan\". \"Bryan -> Ryan\". \"Ryan -> Amanda\". \"Amanda -> Kenneth\". \"Kenneth -> Arthur\". So this chain goes from Austin to Arthur.\n\nNow also \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\". Also \"Alice -> Michelle\". So that's part.\n\nNow also \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\". Also \"Austin -> Douglas\" is from Rachel -> Austin. So \"Rachel -> Austin -> Douglas -> Alice -> Michelle -> ...\" So chain continues.\n\nThus the chain from Shirley includes the same chain after Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, ... So indeed the chain from Shirley merges with the chain from Madison at Arthur. So the graph is a directed tree merging at Arthur. So the only common descendant of Madison and Shirley is Arthur.\n\nThus answer: \"Madison and Shirley share a common descendant.\"\n\nThus option 4.\n\nBut we need to verify if any other node is also a common descendant. Could there be a node that is descendant of both Madison and Shirley besides Arthur? Let's see if any node appears in both reachable sets.\n\nFrom Madison, reachable set includes: Madison, Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa, Aaron, Doris, Richard, Jose, Alexander, Andrea, Arthur. Also includes all descendants of Arthur? Arthur has no children. So only those.\n\nFrom Shirley, reachable set includes: Shirley, Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George, Terry, Charlotte, Carol, Patricia, Bryan, Ryan, Amanda, Kenneth, Arthur. Also includes all descendants of Arthur? None.\n\nThus the only common node is Arthur.\n\nThus answer is 4.\n\nNow check if there is any possibility that the relationship is \"Madison is Shirley's ancestor\" or \"Shirley is Madison's ancestor\"? No, because no path from Madison to Shirley or vice versa.\n\nThus answer is 4.\n\nNow ensure the answer format: <ANSWER>4</ANSWER>.\n\nThus final answer: <ANSWER>4</ANSWER>.","reasoning_details":[{"id":"reasoning-text-1","format":"unknown","index":0,"type":"reasoning.text","text":"We have a problem about lineage relationships with many given statements. The task: Determine the lineage relationship between Madison and Shirley. There are multiple statements: e.g., \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" So Madison is an ancestor of Harold. Also \"Jordan is Harold's descendant.\" So Jordan is descendant of Harold, i.e., Harold is ancestor of Jordan. So we can chain: Madison -> (Harold) -> (Jordan). Also \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\" So Jordan is ancestor of Noah. Then \"Timothy is Noah's descendant.\" So Noah is ancestor of Timothy? Actually \"Timothy is Noah's descendant\" means Timothy is descendant of Noah, i.e., Noah is ancestor of Timothy. So we have: Jordan is ancestor of Noah, and Noah is ancestor of Timothy. So Jordan is also ancestor of Timothy (direct or indirect). Also \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant.\" So Matthew is descendant of Timothy, i.e., Timothy is ancestor of Matthew. So Jordan is also ancestor of Matthew.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nWe have a bunch of statements; we need to deduce relationship between Madison and Shirley. Potential relationships: ancestor, descendant, share a common ancestor, share a common descendant, none.\n\nWe need to parse all statements and construct the genealogical graph (maybe directed graph of \"is ancestor of\" relationships). Then find the relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nGiven the complexity (70+ statements), we need to systematically parse.\n\nDefine a relation: A is ancestor of B means there is a path from A to B following \"is ancestor of\" edges. A is descendant of B means B is ancestor of A. The statements provide direct ancestor/descendant relationships (i.e., immediate). But the graph can be transitive; we need to find any path.\n\nGoal: Determine if Madison is ancestor of Shirley, descendant of Shirley, they share a common ancestor, share a common descendant, or none.\n\nWe'll need to compute all reachable relationships. But given many statements, may be possible that they share a common ancestor, i.e., both are descendants of some person; also they could share a common descendant (someone is descendant of both). Or one is ancestor/descendant of the other. Or none.\n\nThus need to compute all relationships. Could be an answer like \"Madison and Shirley share a common ancestor.\" Or \"Madison is Shirley's ancestor.\" Let's parse.\n\nFirst, list statements:\n\n* Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\n* Eugene is Samantha's ancestor.\n* Doris is Aaron's descendant.\n* Bryan is Patricia's descendant.\n* Jordan is Harold's descendant.\n* Timothy is Noah's descendant.\n* Joyce is Joan's descendant.\n* Scott is Sophia's descendant.\n* Brian is Karen's descendant.\n* Lawrence is Marie's ancestor.\n* Judy is Christina's ancestor.\n* Margaret is Daniel's descendant.\n* Harold is Madison's descendant.\n* Christina is Bradley's ancestor.\n* Barbara is Peter's descendant.\n* Jose is Alexander's ancestor.\n* Jose is Richard's descendant.\n* Austin is Rachel's descendant.\n* Bradley is Ralph's ancestor.\n* Marie is Joan's ancestor.\n* Douglas is Austin's descendant.\n* Richard is Doris's descendant.\n* Evelyn is Shirley's descendant.\n* Jack is Eugene's ancestor.\n* Terry is George's descendant.\n* Donald is Scott's descendant.\n* Amanda is Ryan's descendant.\n* Matthew is Timothy's descendant.\n* Aaron is Melissa's descendant.\n* Andrea is Arthur's ancestor.\n* Mary is Janet's ancestor.\n* Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\n* Rachel is Donald's descendant.\n* Arthur is Kenneth's descendant.\n* Alice is Douglas's descendant.\n* Dorothy is Katherine's descendant.\n* James is Mason's descendant.\n* James is Karen's ancestor.\n* Brandon is Anthony's ancestor.\n* Mason is Anthony's descendant.\n* Amanda is Kenneth's ancestor.\n* Katherine is Janet's descendant.\n* Brandon is Dorothy's descendant.\n* Jack is Ralph's descendant.\n* Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\n* Michelle is Betty's ancestor.\n* Charlotte is Carol's ancestor.\n* Elijah is Nicole's descendant.\n* Patricia is Carol's descendant.\n* Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\n* Hannah is Daniel's ancestor.\n* Alexander is Andrea's ancestor.\n* Matthew is Mary's ancestor.\n* Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\n* Barbara is Nicole's ancestor.\n* Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\n* Elijah is Kevin's ancestor.\n* George is Samantha's descendant.\n* Bryan is Ryan's ancestor.\n* Sophia is Kevin's descendant.\n* Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\n* Charlotte is Terry's descendant.\n* Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\n\nFirst, we need to decide what statements are direct ancestor relationships. For each statement, if X is Y's ancestor, then X -> Y (X is ancestor of Y). If X is Y's descendant, then Y is ancestor of X. So X <- Y (or Y -> X). Let's treat each as a directed edge from ancestor to descendant.\n\nWe'll parse each statement and assign edges accordingly.\n\nWe'll create a set of persons and edges.\n\nList all persons: We'll need to track many.\n\nLet's parse each statement.\n\n1.

Edge: Evelyn -> Theresa.\n\nWe need to check each again for correctness.\n\nNow we have a directed graph.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nLet's identify all edges involving Madison and Shirley.\n\n- Madison -> Harold (from statement 13)\n- Also, other statements: \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" is the same as Madison -> Harold. Already captured.\n\n- There may be other edges with Madison: \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" (already). \"Jordan is Harold's descendant\" means Harold -> Jordan. So Madison -> Harold -> Jordan.\n\n- \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\" means Jordan -> Noah.\n\n- \"Noah is Timothy's ancestor\" (Timothy is Noah's descendant). So Noah -> Timothy.\n\n- \"Timothy is Matthew's descendant\" (Timothy -> Matthew). So chain: Madison -> Harold -> Jordan -> Noah -> Timothy -> Matthew.\n\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" (Matthew -> Mary). So chain continues: Madison -> ... -> Mary.\n\n- \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\"? Wait, \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\" is same as Timothy -> Matthew (already). So consistent.\n\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" (Matthew -> Mary). So Matthew is ancestor of Mary.\n\n- \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\" is earlier. So we have both relationships: Timothy is ancestor of Matthew (Timothy -> Matthew) and Matthew is ancestor of Mary (Matthew -> Mary). So chain.\n\n- \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\" and \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" => Timothy -> Matthew -> Mary.\n\n- Also \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" is already captured.\n\n- \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\" is captured.\n\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" we have.\n\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" we have.\n\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\" is included.\n\nNow \"Shirley\" appears only in \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" which is Shirley -> Evelyn.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" (Evelyn -> Theresa). Also \"Evelyn is Shirley descendant\" we have.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" we have.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\"? Actually \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" is Theresa -> Peter. Already captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" (Evelyn -> Theresa). So chain: Shirley -> Evelyn -> Theresa.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" (Theresa -> Peter). So Shirley -> Evelyn -> Theresa -> Peter.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" is reverse: Evelyn -> Theresa.\n\nNow \"Shirley\" also appears maybe elsewhere? Not in other statements.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nWe need to see if there is a directed path between Madison and Shirley (i.e., Madison is ancestor of Shirley) or reverse (Shirley is ancestor of Madison). Or they share a common ancestor (some node X such that both are descendants of X). Or share a common descendant (some node Y that is descendant of both). Or none.\n\nThus we need to compute ancestors/descendants.\n\nGiven the graph, we can compute reachability.\n\nFirst, list all nodes and edges. Let's compile the adjacency list.\n\nI'll maintain a mapping: node -> list of children (descendants). We'll also need reverse mapping for ancestors.\n\nDefine edges (ancestor -> descendant). We'll list all.\n\nEdges:\n\n1. Alice -> Michelle\n2. Eugene -> Samantha\n3. Aaron -> Doris\n4. Patricia -> Bryan\n5. Harold -> Jordan\n6. Noah -> Timothy\n7. Joan -> Joyce\n8. Sophia -> Scott\n9. Karen -> Brian\n10. Lawrence -> Marie\n11. Judy -> Christina\n12. Daniel -> Margaret\n13. Madison -> Harold\n14. Christina -> Bradley\n15. Peter -> Barbara\n16. Jose -> Alexander\n17. Richard -> Jose\n18. Rachel -> Austin\n19. Bradley -> Ralph\n20. Marie -> Joan\n21. Austin -> Douglas\n22. Doris -> Richard\n23. Shirley -> Evelyn\n24. Jack -> Eugene\n25. George -> Terry\n26. Scott -> Donald\n27. Ryan -> Amanda\n28. Timothy -> Matthew\n29. Melissa -> Aaron\n30. Andrea -> Arthur\n31. Mary -> Janet\n32. Betty -> Hannah\n33. Donald -> Rachel\n34. Kenneth -> Arthur\n35. Douglas -> Alice\n36. Katherine -> Dorothy\n37. Mason -> James\n38. James -> Karen\n39. Brandon -> Anthony\n40. Anthony -> Mason\n41. Amanda -> Kenneth\n42. Janet -> Katherine\n43. Dorothy -> Brandon\n44. Ralph -> Jack\n45. Theresa -> Peter\n46. Michelle -> Betty\n47. Charlotte -> Carol\n48. Nicole -> Elijah\n49. Carol -> Patricia\n50. Jordan -> Noah\n51. Hannah -> Daniel\n52. Alexander -> Andrea\n53. Matthew -> Mary\n54. Joyce -> Melissa\n55. Barbara -> Nicole\n56. Brian -> Lawrence\n57. Elijah -> Kevin\n58. Samantha -> George\n59. Bryan -> Ryan\n60. Kevin -> Sophia\n61. Margaret -> Judy\n62. Terry -> Charlotte\n63. Evelyn -> Theresa\n\nCheck each statement again for completeness:\n\n- \"Alice is Michelle's ancestor.\" Yes (Alice -> Michelle)\n- \"Eugene is Samantha's ancestor.\" (Eugene -> Samantha)\n- \"Doris is Aaron's descendant.\" (Aaron -> Doris)\n- \"Bryan is Patricia's descendant.\" (Patricia -> Bryan)\n- \"Jordan is Harold's descendant.\" (Harold -> Jordan)\n- \"Timothy is Noah's descendant.\" (Noah -> Timothy)\n- \"Joyce is Joan's descendant.\" (Joan -> Joyce)\n- \"Scott is Sophia's descendant.\" (Sophia -> Scott)\n- \"Brian is Karen's descendant.\" (Karen -> Brian)\n- \"Lawrence is Marie's ancestor.\" (Lawrence -> Marie)\n- \"Judy is Christina's ancestor.\" (Judy -> Christina)\n- \"Margaret is Daniel's descendant.\" (Daniel -> Margaret)\n- \"Harold is Madison's descendant.\" (Madison -> Harold)\n- \"Christina is Bradley's ancestor.\" (Christina -> Bradley)\n- \"Barbara is Peter's descendant.\" (Peter -> Barbara)\n- \"Jose is Alexander's ancestor.\" (Jose -> Alexander)\n- \"Jose is Richard's descendant.\" (Richard -> Jose)\n- \"Austin is Rachel's descendant.\" (Rachel -> Austin)\n- \"Bradley is Ralph's ancestor.\" (Bradley -> Ralph)\n- \"Marie is Joan's ancestor.\" (Marie -> Joan)\n- \"Douglas is Austin's descendant.\" (Austin -> Douglas)\n- \"Richard is Doris's descendant.\" (Doris -> Richard)\n- \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant.\" (Shirley -> Evelyn)\n- \"Jack is Eugene's ancestor.\" (Jack -> Eugene)\n- \"Terry is George's descendant.\" (George -> Terry)\n- \"Donald is Scott's descendant.\" (Scott -> Donald)\n- \"Amanda is Ryan's descendant.\" (Ryan -> Amanda)\n- \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant.\" (Timothy -> Matthew)\n- \"Aaron is Melissa's descendant.\" (Melissa -> Aaron)\n- \"Andrea is Arthur's ancestor.\" (Andrea -> Arthur)\n- \"Mary is Janet's ancestor.\" (Mary -> Janet)\n- \"Betty is Hannah's ancestor.\" (Betty -> Hannah)\n- \"Rachel is Donald's descendant.\" (Donald -> Rachel)\n- \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant.\" (Kenneth -> Arthur)\n- \"Alice is Douglas's descendant.\" (Douglas -> Alice)\n- \"Dorothy is Katherine's descendant.\" (Katherine -> Dorothy)\n- \"James is Mason's descendant.\" (Mason -> James)\n- \"James is Karen's ancestor.\" (James -> Karen)\n- \"Brandon is Anthony's ancestor.\" (Brandon -> Anthony)\n- \"Mason is Anthony's descendant.\" (Anthony -> Mason)\n- \"Amanda is Kenneth's ancestor.\" (Amanda -> Kenneth)\n- \"Katherine is Janet's descendant.\" (Janet -> Katherine)\n- \"Brandon is Dorothy's descendant.\" (Dorothy -> Brandon)\n- \"Jack is Ralph's descendant.\" (Ralph -> Jack)\n- \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor.\" (Theresa -> Peter)\n- \"Michelle is Betty's ancestor.\" (Michelle -> Betty)\n- \"Charlotte is Carol's ancestor.\" (Charlotte -> Carol)\n- \"Elijah is Nicole's descendant.\" (Nicole -> Elijah)\n- \"Patricia is Carol's descendant.\" (Carol -> Patricia)\n- \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor.\" (Jordan -> Noah)\n- \"Hannah is Daniel's ancestor.\" (Hannah -> Daniel)\n- \"Alexander is Andrea's ancestor.\" (Alexander -> Andrea)\n- \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor.\" (Matthew -> Mary)\n- \"Joyce is Melissa's ancestor.\" (Joyce -> Melissa)\n- \"Barbara is Nicole's ancestor.\" (Barbara -> Nicole)\n- \"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor.\" (Brian -> Lawrence)\n- \"Elijah is Kevin's ancestor.\" (Elijah -> Kevin)\n- \"George is Samantha's descendant.\" (Samantha -> George)\n- \"Bryan is Ryan's ancestor.\" (Bryan -> Ryan)\n- \"Sophia is Kevin's descendant.\" (Kevin -> Sophia)\n- \"Margaret is Judy's ancestor.\" (Margaret -> Judy)\n- \"Charlotte is Terry's descendant.\" (Terry -> Charlotte)\n- \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant.\" (Evelyn -> Theresa)\n\nAll good.\n\nNow we need to compute reachability.\n\nGoal: Relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nFirst, compute all ancestors and descendants for Madison and Shirley.\n\nWe'll need to see if any path from Madison to Shirley (Madison is ancestor of Shirley) or from Shirley to Madison (Shirley is ancestor of Madison). Also if they share a common ancestor (i.e., there exists some X such that both are descendants of X). Or share a common descendant (there exists Y such that both are ancestors of Y). Or none.\n\nGiven the graph, we need to see connectivity.\n\nWe have many nodes, some may be disconnected.\n\nFirst, list all nodes (maybe 50+). Let's list them:\n\nAlice\nMichelle\nEugene\nSamantha\nDoris\nAaron\nBryan\nPatricia\nHarold\nJordan\nNoah\nTimothy\nJoyce\nJoan\nScott\nSophia\nBrian\nKaren\nLawrence\nMarie\nJudy\nChristina\nMargaret\nDaniel\nBradley\nPeter\nBarbara\nJose\nAlexander\nRichard\nAustin\nRachel\nBradley (already)\nRalph\nGeorge\nTerry\nDonald\nAmanda\nMatthew\nMelissa\nAaron (already)\nAndrea\nArthur\nMary\nJanet\nBetty\nHannah\nEvelyn\nJack\nDorothy\nKatherine\nJames\nMason\nAnthony\nBrandon\nElijah\nNicole\nKevin\nSamantha (already)\nTheresa\nCatherine? Actually \"Katherine\" appears.\nCharlotte\nCarol\nPatricia (already)\nHannah (already)\nMatthew (already)\nJoyce (already)\nBarbara (already)\nBrian (already)\nElijah (already)\nGeorge (already)\nBryan (already)\nSophia (already)\nMargaret (already)\nShirley\n\nWe have also \"Shirley\". Also \"Evelyn\" etc.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Madison and Shirley.\n\nFirst, we need to see if there is any path connecting them.\n\nLet's compute the ancestors/descendants for Madison.\n\nWe have direct descendant: Madison -> Harold.\n\nHarold -> Jordan (from Harold -> Jordan). Also Jordan -> Noah (Jordan -> Noah). Also Noah -> Timothy (Noah -> Timothy). Also Timothy -> Matthew (Timothy -> Matthew). Also Matthew -> Mary (Matthew -> Mary). Also Mary -> Janet (Mary -> Janet). Also Janet -> Katherine (Janet -> Katherine). Also Katherine -> Dorothy (Katherine -> Dorothy). Also Dorothy -> Brandon (Dorothy -> Brandon). Also Brandon -> Anthony (Brandon -> Anthony). Also Anthony -> Mason (Anthony -> Mason). Also Mason -> James (Mason -> James). Also James -> Karen (James -> Karen). Also Karen -> Brian (Karen -> Brian). Also Brian -> Lawrence (Brian -> Lawrence). Also Lawrence -> Marie (Lawrence -> Marie). Also Marie -> Joan (Marie -> Joan). Also Joan -> Joyce (Joan -> Joyce). Also Joyce -> Melissa (Joyce -> Melissa). Also Melissa -> Aaron (Melissa -> Aaron). Also Aaron -> Doris (Aaron -> Doris). Also Doris -> Richard (Doris -> Richard). Also Richard -> Jose (Richard -> Jose). Also Jose -> Alexander (Jose -> Alexander). Also Alexander -> Andrea (Alexander -> Andrea). Also Andrea -> Arthur (Andrea -> Arthur). Also Arthur -> Kenneth (Kenneth -> Arthur). Wait, check: we have Kenneth -> Arthur (Kenneth is ancestor of Arthur). Actually statement: \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant.\" So Kenneth -> Arthur. So from Arthur we need to go to ... Actually we have Arthur's descendants? Let's see: \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant.\" So Arthur is descendant of Kenneth. So we have edge: Kenneth -> Arthur. Does Arthur have any children? There is \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" and \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? No other statements about Arthur being ancestor of someone. Actually \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" is the only direct. There's also \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" (makes sense). There's also \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? Already.\n\nThere is \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" and also \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? Not needed.\n\nBut we also have \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" and \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? Already.\n\nAlso \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? Already.\n\nBut also \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\"? Ok.\n\nNow, we have \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\", meaning Kenneth is ancestor of Arthur. Also \"Andrea is Arthur's ancestor\". So Andrea -> Arthur. That is a direct edge. So we have Andrea -> Arthur.\n\nThus from Arthur we can go to ... any child edges? Let's see if Arthur appears as ancestor in any statements: \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant.\" That's it. \"Andrea is Arthur's ancestor.\" That's a reverse relationship (Andrea -> Arthur). \"Arthur is Kenneth's descendant\" is the only one. No statements about Arthur being ancestor of someone else. So Arthur has no outgoing edges (no children). So chain stops.\n\nThus the path from Madison down to Arthur ends at Arthur (no further children). But there may be other branches.\n\nBut also there is \"Andrew\"? Not present.\n\nNow, also we have \"Madison -> Harold -> Jordan -> Noah -> Timothy -> Matthew -> Mary -> Janet -> Katherine -> Dorothy -> Brandon -> Anthony -> Mason -> James -> Karen -> Brian -> Lawrence -> Marie -> Joan -> Joyce -> Melissa -> Aaron -> Doris -> Richard -> Jose -> Alexander -> Andrea -> Arthur. That's a long chain.\n\nBut there may be branching earlier: e.g., from Harold we also have \"Harold -> Jordan\". Already in chain. Also \"Harold -> Jordan\"? That's the only child of Harold. Also \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" is the only child of Madison.\n\nFrom Jordan we have \"Jordan -> Noah\". Also \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\" which we already have. Also \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\" is same direction. Also \"Jordan is Harold's descendant\" we have. Also \"Jordan is Noah's ancestor\". So Jordan has child Noah.\n\nFrom Noah we have \"Noah -> Timothy\". Also \"Timothy is Noah's descendant\" we have.\n\nFrom Timothy we have \"Timothy -> Matthew\". Also \"Matthew is Timothy's descendant\". So only child.\n\nFrom Matthew we have \"Matthew -> Mary\". Also \"Matthew is Mary's ancestor\". So child Mary.\n\nFrom Mary we have \"Mary -> Janet\". Also \"Mary is Janet's ancestor\". So child Janet.\n\nFrom Janet we have \"Janet -> Katherine\". Also \"Katherine is Janet's descendant\". So child Katherine.\n\nFrom Katherine we have \"Katherine -> Dorothy\". Also \"Katherine is Janet's descendant\". So child Dorothy.\n\nFrom Dorothy we have \"Dorothy -> Brandon\". Also \"Brandon is Dorothy's descendant\". So child Brandon.\n\nFrom Brandon we have \"Brandon -> Anthony\". Also \"Brandon is Anthony's ancestor\". So child Anthony.\n\nFrom Anthony we have \"Anthony -> Mason\". Also \"Mason is Anthony's descendant\". So child Mason.\n\nFrom Mason we have \"Mason -> James\". Also \"Mason is Anthony's descendant\"? Actually \"Mason is Anthony's descendant\" is the same direction. So child James.\n\nFrom James we have \"James -> Karen\". Also \"James is Karen's ancestor\". So child Karen.\n\nFrom Karen we have \"Karen -> Brian\". Also \"Karen is Brian's ancestor\". So child Brian.\n\nFrom Brian we have \"Brian -> Lawrence\". Also \"Brian is Lawrence's ancestor\". So child Lawrence.\n\nFrom Lawrence we have \"Lawrence -> Marie\". So child Marie.\n\nFrom Marie we have \"Marie -> Joan\". So child Joan.\n\nFrom Joan we have \"Joan -> Joyce\". So child Joyce.\n\nFrom Joyce we have \"Joyce -> Melissa\". So child Melissa.\n\nFrom Melissa we have \"Melissa -> Aaron\". So child Aaron.\n\nFrom Aaron we have \"Aaron -> Doris\". So child Doris.\n\nFrom Doris we have \"Doris -> Richard\". So child Richard.\n\nFrom Richard we have \"Richard -> Jose\". So child Jose.\n\nFrom Jose we have \"Jose -> Alexander\". So child Alexander.\n\nFrom Alexander we have \"Alexander -> Andrea\". So child Andrea.\n\nFrom Andrea we have \"Andrea -> Arthur\". So child Arthur.\n\nArthur has no children.\n\nThus the chain from Madison goes down to Arthur.\n\nThus all nodes in this chain are descendants of Madison.\n\nThus Madison's descendants include: Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa, Aaron, Doris, Richard, Jose, Alexander, Andrea, Arthur. Also includes many others indirectly via branching? Actually this chain includes all nodes that are reachable from Madison via the directed graph. There might be branching at each node: each node may have other children besides the one in the chain. Let's check each node for other outgoing edges.\n\nCheck each node's adjacency list (list of children). We'll need to examine all edges for each node.\n\nLet's list all nodes with outgoing edges:\n\nAlice -> Michelle\n\nEugene -> Samantha\n\nAaron -> Doris\n\nPatricia -> Bryan\n\nHarold -> Jordan\n\nNoah -> Timothy\n\nJoan -> Joyce\n\nSophia -> Scott\n\nKaren -> Brian\n\nLawrence -> Marie\n\nJudy -> Christina\n\nDaniel -> Margaret\n\nMadison -> Harold\n\nChristina -> Bradley\n\nPeter -> Barbara\n\nJose -> Alexander\n\nRichard -> Jose\n\nRachel -> Austin\n\nBradley -> Ralph\n\nMarie -> Joan\n\nAustin -> Douglas\n\nDoris -> Richard\n\nShirley -> Evelyn\n\nJack -> Eugene\n\nGeorge -> Terry\n\nScott -> Donald\n\nRyan -> Amanda\n\nTimothy -> Matthew\n\nMelissa -> Aaron\n\nAndrea -> Arthur\n\nMary -> Janet\n\nBetty -> Hannah\n\nDonald -> Rachel\n\nKenneth -> Arthur\n\nDouglas -> Alice\n\nKatherine -> Dorothy\n\nMason -> James\n\nJames -> Karen\n\nBrandon -> Anthony\n\nAnthony -> Mason\n\nAmanda -> Kenneth\n\nJanet -> Katherine\n\nDorothy -> Brandon\n\nRalph -> Jack\n\nTheresa -> Peter\n\nMichelle -> Betty\n\nCharlotte -> Carol\n\nNicole -> Elijah\n\nCarol -> Patricia\n\nJordan -> Noah\n\nHannah -> Daniel\n\nAlexander -> Andrea\n\nMatthew -> Mary\n\nJoyce -> Melissa\n\nBarbara -> Nicole\n\nBrian -> Lawrence\n\nElijah -> Kevin\n\nSamantha -> George\n\nBryan -> Ryan\n\nKevin -> Sophia\n\nMargaret -> Judy\n\nTerry -> Charlotte\n\nEvelyn -> Theresa\n\nAlso \"Evelyn -> Theresa\" we have.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" is same direction (Evelyn -> Theresa). Already captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" (Theresa -> Peter). Already captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" we have.\n\nNow \"Evelyn is Shirley descendant\" (Shirley -> Evelyn). Already.\n\nNow \"Shirley -> Evelyn\". Already.\n\nNow \"Evelyn -> Theresa\". Already.\n\nNow \"Theresa -> Peter\". Already.\n\nNow \"Peter -> Barbara\". Already.\n\nNow \"Barbara -> Nicole\". Already.\n\nNow \"Nicole -> Elijah\". Already.\n\nNow \"Elijah -> Kevin\". Already.\n\nNow \"Kevin -> Sophia\". Already.\n\nNow \"Sophia -> Scott\". Already.\n\nNow \"Scott -> Donald\". Already.\n\nNow \"Donald -> Rachel\". Already.\n\nNow \"Rachel -> Austin\". Already.\n\nNow \"Austin -> Douglas\". Already.\n\nNow \"Douglas -> Alice\". Already.\n\nNow \"Alice -> Michelle\". Already.\n\nNow \"Michelle -> Betty\". Already.\n\nNow \"Betty -> Hannah\". Already.\n\nNow \"Hannah -> Daniel\". Already.\n\nNow \"Daniel -> Margaret\". Already.\n\nNow \"Margaret -> Judy\". Already.\n\nNow \"Judy -> Christina\". Already.\n\nNow \"Christina -> Bradley\". Already.\n\nNow \"Bradley -> Ralph\". Already.\n\nNow \"Ralph -> Jack\". Already.\n\nNow \"Jack -> Eugene\". Already.\n\nNow \"Eugene -> Samantha\". Already.\n\nNow \"Samantha -> George\". Already.\n\nNow \"George -> Terry\". Already.\n\nNow \"Terry -> Charlotte\". Already.\n\nNow \"Charlotte -> Carol\". Already.\n\nNow \"Carol -> Patricia\". Already.\n\nNow \"Patricia -> Bryan\". Already.\n\nNow \"Bryan -> Ryan\". Already.\n\nNow \"Ryan -> Amanda\". Already.\n\nNow \"Amanda -> Kenneth\". Already.\n\nNow \"Kenneth -> Arthur\". Already.\n\nNow \"Arthur -> (none)\". So chain ends.\n\nNow also \"Evelyn -> Theresa\" is part of that chain.\n\nNow \"Theresa -> Peter\" is also part.\n\nThus the graph appears to be a single large directed tree (or DAG) with many nodes. It seems all nodes are connected in a single chain from Madison to Arthur and then also from Shirley to Evelyn to Theresa to Peter to Barbara to Nicole to Elijah to Kevin to Sophia to Scott to Donald to Rachel to Austin to Douglas to Alice to Michelle to Betty to Hannah to Daniel to Margaret to Judy to Christina to Bradley to Ralph to Jack to Eugene to Samantha to George to Terry to Charlotte to Carol to Patricia to Bryan to Ryan to Amanda to Kenneth to Arthur. Actually we need to check if there are any cycles or branching.\n\nWe see that there is a chain from Madison all the way down to Arthur (through many nodes). Then from Arthur, there is no further children. However, we also have the chain from Shirley to Evelyn to Theresa to Peter to Barbara to Nicole to Elijah to Kevin to Sophia to Scott to Donald to Rachel to Austin to Douglas to Alice to Michelle to Betty to Hannah to Daniel to Margaret to Judy to Christina to Bradley to Ralph to Jack to Eugene to Samantha to George to Terry to Charlotte to Carol to Patricia to Bryan to Ryan to Amanda to Kenneth to Arthur. Wait, note that we already have Arthur as a node in both chains: one from Madison to Arthur, and also the chain from Shirley passes through Arthur at the end. Indeed, the chain from Shirley goes: Shirley -> Evelyn -> Theresa -> Peter -> Barbara -> Nicole -> Elijah -> Kevin -> Sophia -> Scott -> Donald -> Rachel -> Austin -> Douglas -> Alice -> Michelle -> Betty -> Hannah -> Daniel -> Margaret -> Judy -> Christina -> Bradley -> Ralph -> Jack -> Eugene -> Samantha -> George -> Terry -> Charlotte -> Carol -> Patricia -> Bryan -> Ryan -> Amanda -> Kenneth -> Arthur. So this chain ends at Arthur, which is also a descendant of Madison.\n\nThus we have a path from Madison to Arthur, and from Shirley to Arthur (through the chain). Actually from Shirley to Arthur is a path: Shirley -> Evelyn -> ... -> Arthur. And from Madison to Arthur is also a path: Madison -> ... -> Arthur. So both Madison and Shirley are ancestors of Arthur (or rather, they are ancestors of Arthur). Wait, careful: In the graph, edges go from ancestor to descendant. So if we have a path from Madison to Arthur, that means Madison is ancestor of Arthur. If we have a path from Shirley to Arthur, that means Shirley is ancestor of Arthur. So both Madison and Shirley are ancestors of Arthur. So they share a common descendant (Arthur). But the question asks for relationship between Madison and Shirley: do they share a common ancestor, a common descendant, is one ancestor of the other, etc.\n\nFrom the graph, we see that there is a path from Madison to Arthur (so Madison is ancestor of Arthur). There is also a path from Shirley to Arthur (so Shirley is ancestor of Arthur). Thus they share a common descendant (Arthur). However, we need to check if there are any other connections.\n\nBut also, there might be a path from Madison to Shirley or from Shirley to Madison. Let's examine.\n\nFrom Madison, we have a chain down to Arthur. Does this chain include Shirley? No. The chain from Madison includes nodes: Madison, Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa, Aaron, Doris, Richard, Jose, Alexander, Andrea, Arthur. Does it include Shirley? No. Does it include Evelyn? No. Does it include any of the chain from Shirley? Let's check if any of those nodes appear in both chains.\n\nChain from Madison: we have Madison, Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa, Aaron, Doris, Richard, Jose, Alexander, Andrea, Arthur.\n\nChain from Shirley: Shirley, Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George, Terry, Charlotte, Carol, Patricia, Bryan, Ryan, Amanda, Kenneth, Arthur.\n\nThus the only overlapping node is Arthur. Indeed, Arthur appears at the end of both chains. So they share a common descendant (Arthur). But they also share a common ancestor? Let's check if there is any node that is ancestor of both Madison and Shirley. Does any node have a path to both? Possibly there could be a node that is an ancestor of both Madison and Shirley, meaning there is a path from that node to Madison and also to Shirley. But we need to see if any node appears above both Madison and Shirley in the graph.\n\nFrom the edges, we have no edges pointing to Madison (no statements like \"X is Madison's ancestor\" or \"X is Madison's descendant\"? Actually we have \"Harold is Madison's descendant\" which is Madison -> Harold. So Madison is the root of its chain. There is no edge into Madison (i.e., no one is ancestor of Madison). So Madison is a root.\n\nSimilarly, Shirley has no incoming edges (no statement like \"X is Shirley ancestor\" or \"X is Shirley descendant\"? Actually \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" means Shirley -> Evelyn. So Shirley is root of its chain. No incoming edges.\n\nThus Madison and Shirley are both roots of separate trees that eventually converge at Arthur (common descendant). So they share a common descendant (Arthur). They do not share a common ancestor (since they are roots). Also, there is no path from Madison to Shirley (i.e., Madison is not ancestor of Shirley) because there is no path from Madison to any of the nodes in Shirley's chain except Arthur (which is at the bottom). But to be ancestor of Shirley, there would need to be a path from Madison to Shirley. Does Madison have a path to Shirley? Let's see: Madison -> ... -> Arthur. Does Arthur have a child? No. So no path to Shirley. So not ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, Shirley is not ancestor of Madison, because no path from Shirley to Madison.\n\nThus the relationship is: Madison and Shirley share a common descendant (Arthur). Also they share a common descendant maybe more than one? Possibly also share other common descendants like maybe some other node that is reachable from both. Let's check if any other node is reachable from both. The only overlapping node is Arthur, because the two trees converge at Arthur. There might be other nodes reachable from both if there are other connections after Arthur, but Arthur has no children. So the only common descendant is Arthur.\n\nThus answer: \"Madison and Shirley share a common descendant.\" That corresponds to option 4: \"Madison and Shirley share a common descendant.\"\n\nThus answer: <ANSWER>4</ANSWER>.\n\nBut before finalizing, we need to double-check the graph for any potential alternative paths that could cause Madison to be ancestor of Shirley or vice versa. Also check if there might be a path from Madison to Shirley via some other node besides Arthur, perhaps via a different branch that merges earlier. But the graph seems to be a single directed tree merging at Arthur. But we need to verify all edges for any cross-connections.\n\nLet's systematically compute the graph and find all reachable nodes from each root.\n\nWe'll parse all edges again and see if any node appears in both subtrees besides Arthur.\n\nFirst, list all nodes and edges again. Then identify root nodes (nodes with no incoming edges). Then see which nodes are reachable from each root.\n\nWe have root nodes: nodes with no incoming edges (i.e., not appearing as descendant in any statement). Let's find them.\n\nFrom edges list, we can find all nodes that appear as destination (descendant) in any edge. Let's compile all destinations:\n\nFrom edges:\n\nAlice -> Michelle (destination: Michelle)\nEugene -> Samantha (destination: Samantha)\nAaron -> Doris (dest: Doris)\nPatricia -> Bryan (dest: Bryan)\nHarold -> Jordan (dest: Jordan)\nNoah -> Timothy (dest: Timothy)\nJoan -> Joyce (dest: Joyce)\nSophia -> Scott (dest: Scott)\nKaren -> Brian (dest: Brian)\nLawrence -> Marie (dest: Marie)\nJudy -> Christina (dest: Christina)\nDaniel -> Margaret (dest: Margaret)\nMadison -> Harold (dest: Harold)\nChristina -> Bradley (dest: Bradley)\nPeter -> Barbara (dest: Barbara)\nJose -> Alexander (dest: Alexander)\nRichard -> Jose (dest: Jose)\nRachel -> Austin (dest: Austin)\nBradley -> Ralph (dest: Ralph)\nMarie -> Joan (dest: Joan)\nAustin -> Douglas (dest: Douglas)\nDoris -> Richard (dest: Richard)\nShirley -> Evelyn (dest: Evelyn)\nJack -> Eugene (dest: Eugene)\nGeorge -> Terry (dest: Terry)\nScott -> Donald (dest: Donald)\nRyan -> Amanda (dest: Amanda)\nTimothy -> Matthew (dest: Matthew)\nMelissa -> Aaron (dest: Aaron)\nAndrea -> Arthur (dest: Arthur)\nMary -> Janet (dest: Janet)\nBetty -> Hannah (dest: Hannah)\nDonald -> Rachel (dest: Rachel)\nKenneth -> Arthur (dest: Arthur)\nDouglas -> Alice (dest: Alice)\nKatherine -> Dorothy (dest: Dorothy)\nMason -> James (dest: James)\nJames -> Karen (dest: Karen)\nBrandon -> Anthony (dest: Anthony)\nAnthony -> Mason (dest: Mason)\nAmanda -> Kenneth (dest: Kenneth)\nJanet -> Katherine (dest: Katherine)\nDorothy -> Brandon (dest: Brandon)\nRalph -> Jack (dest: Jack)\nTheresa -> Peter (dest: Peter)\nMichelle -> Betty (dest: Betty)\nCharlotte -> Carol (dest: Carol)\nNicole -> Elijah (dest: Elijah)\nCarol -> Patricia (dest: Patricia)\nJordan -> Noah (dest: Noah)\nHannah -> Daniel (dest: Daniel)\nAlexander -> Andrea (dest: Andrea)\nMatthew -> Mary (dest: Mary)\nJoyce -> Melissa (dest: Melissa)\nBarbara -> Nicole (dest: Nicole)\nBrian -> Lawrence (dest: Lawrence)\nElijah -> Kevin (dest: Kevin)\nSamantha -> George (dest: George)\nBryan -> Ryan (dest: Ryan)\nKevin -> Sophia (dest: Sophia)\nMargaret -> Judy (dest: Judy)\nTerry -> Charlotte (dest: Charlotte)\nEvelyn -> Theresa (dest: Theresa)\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" is same direction (Evelyn -> Theresa). Already.\n\nThus all destinations (descendants) are: Michelle, Samantha, Doris, Bryan, Jordan, Timothy, Joyce, Scott, Brian, Marie, Christina, Margaret, Harold, Bradley, Barbara, Alexander, Jose, Austin, Ralph, Joan, Douglas, Richard, Evelyn, Eugene, Terry, Donald, Amanda, Matthew, Aaron, Arthur, Janet, Hannah, Rachel, Arthur (again), Alice, Dorothy, James, Karen, Anthony, Mason, Kenneth, Katherine, Brandon, Jack, Peter, Betty, Carol, Elijah, Patricia, Noah, Daniel, Andrea, Mary, Melissa, Nicole, Lawrence, Kevin, George, Ryan, Sophia, Judy, Charlotte, Theresa.\n\nNow we need to see which nodes are not in this destination list; those are roots (no incoming edges). Let's list all nodes that appear anywhere (both as source or destination). Then find those not in destination list.\n\nList all nodes that appear as source:\n\nAlice, Eugene, Aaron, Patricia, Harold, Noah, Joan, Sophia, Karen, Lawrence, Judy, Daniel, Madison, Christina, Peter, Jose, Richard, Rachel, Bradley, Marie, Austin, Doris, Shirley, Jack, George, Scott, Ryan, Timothy, Melissa, Andrea, Mary, Betty, Donald, Kenneth, Douglas, Katherine, Mason, James, Brandon, Anthony, Amanda, Janet, Dorothy, Ralph, Theresa, Michelle, Charlotte, Nicole, Carol, Jordan, Hannah, Alexander, Joyce, Barbara, Brian, Elijah, Samantha, Bryan, Kevin, Terry, Evelyn, (also maybe others: \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" already captured). Also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" is same direction.\n\nAlso \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Peter's ancestor\" captured.\n\nAlso \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" is same.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk enough.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nStop.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nStop.\n\nNow also \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" captured.\n\nOk.\n\nNow we have all nodes.\n\nNow find nodes that are not in destination list (i.e., no incoming edges). Let's list all nodes from source list:\n\n- Alice (source) appears also as destination (Douglas -> Alice). So Alice has incoming edge from Douglas. So not root.\n\n- Eugene (source) appears also as destination (Jack -> Eugene). So Eugene has incoming from Jack. Not root.\n\n- Aaron (source) appears also as destination (Melissa -> Aaron). So not root.\n\n- Patricia (source) appears also as destination (Carol -> Patricia). So not root.\n\n- Harold (source) appears also as destination (Madison -> Harold).

So not root.\n\n- Doris (source) appears also as destination (Aaron -> Doris). So not root.\n\n- Shirley (source) appears also as destination? No. So Shirley is a root (no incoming edges). Actually check: is there any statement where someone is \"Shirley's descendant\"? Yes: Evelyn is Shirley's descendant. That is Shirley -> Evelyn. So Evelyn is descendant of Shirley. But is there any statement like \"X is Shirley's ancestor\"? No. So Shirley has no incoming edges. So Shirley is a root.\n\n- Jack (source) appears also as destination (Ralph -> Jack).

So not root.\n\n- Brandon (source) appears also as destination (Dorothy -> Brandon). So not root.\n\n- Anthony (source) appears also as destination (Brandon -> Anthony).

So not root.\n\n- Evelyn (source) appears also as destination (Shirley -> Evelyn). So not root.\n\nThus the only nodes without incoming edges (roots) are Madison and Shirley. Possibly also others? Let's double-check if any other node appears as source but not as destination. Let's check each source again for being also a destination:\n\n- Alice (source) appears as destination (Douglas -> Alice). So not root.\n\n- Eugene appears as destination (Jack -> Eugene). Not root.\n\n- Aaron appears as destination (Melissa -> Aaron). Not root.\n\n- Patricia appears as destination (Carol -> Patricia). Not root.\n\n- Harold appears as destination (Madison -> Harold).

Not root.\n\n- Austin appears as destination (Rachel -> Austin). Not root.\n\n- Doris appears as destination (Aaron -> Doris). Not root.\n\n- Shirley appears as destination? No. So root.\n\n- Jack appears as destination (Ralph -> Jack). Not root.\n\n- George appears as destination (Samantha -> George). Not root.\n\n- Scott appears as destination (Sophia -> Scott). Not root.\n\n- Ryan appears as destination (Bryan -> Ryan). Not root.\n\n- Timothy appears as destination (Noah -> Timothy). Not root.\n\n- Melissa appears as destination (Joyce -> Melissa). Not root.\n\n- Andrea appears as destination (Alexander -> Andrea). Not root.\n\n- Mary appears as destination (Matthew -> Mary). Not root.\n\n- Betty appears as destination (Michelle -> Betty). Not root.\n\n- Donald appears as destination (Scott -> Donald). Not root.\n\n- Kenneth appears as destination (Amanda -> Kenneth). Not root.\n\n- Douglas appears as destination (Austin -> Douglas). Not root.\n\n- Katherine appears as destination (Janet -> Katherine). Not root.\n\n- Mason appears as destination (Anthony -> Mason). Not root.\n\n- James appears as destination (Mason -> James). Not root.\n\n- Brandon appears as destination (Dorothy -> Brandon). Not root.\n\n- Anthony appears as destination (Brandon -> Anthony). Not root.\n\n- Amanda appears as destination (Ryan -> Amanda). Not root.\n\n- Janet appears as destination (Mary -> Janet). Not root.\n\n- Dorothy appears as destination (Katherine -> Dorothy). Not root.\n\n- Ralph appears as destination (Bradley -> Ralph). Not root.\n\n- Theresa appears as destination (Evelyn -> Theresa). Not root.\n\n- Michelle appears as destination (Alice -> Michelle). Not root.\n\n- Charlotte appears as destination (Terry -> Charlotte). Not root.\n\n- Nicole appears as destination (Barbara -> Nicole). Not root.\n\n- Carol appears as destination (Charlotte -> Carol). Not root.\n\n- Jordan appears as destination (Harold -> Jordan). Not root.\n\n- Hannah appears as destination (Betty -> Hannah). Not root.\n\n- Alexander appears as destination (Jose -> Alexander). Not root.\n\n- Joyce appears as destination (Joan -> Joyce). Not root.\n\n- Barbara appears as destination (Peter -> Barbara). Not root.\n\n- Brian appears as destination (Karen -> Brian). Not root.\n\n- Elijah appears as destination (Nicole -> Elijah). Not root.\n\n- Samantha appears as destination (Eugene -> Samantha). Not root.\n\n- Bryan appears as destination (Patricia -> Bryan). Not root.\n\n- Kevin appears as destination (Elijah -> Kevin). Not root.\n\n- Terry appears as destination (George -> Terry). Not root.\n\n- Evelyn appears as destination (Shirley -> Evelyn). Not root.\n\nThus indeed only Madison and Shirley have no incoming edges. So they are roots.\n\nNow the graph is a directed forest (actually a directed tree merging at Arthur). Let's verify that the graph is indeed a tree (no cycles). Check for cycles: Possibly there could be cycles like a node appears both as ancestor and descendant of itself indirectly. Let's check for potential cycles.\n\nWe have edges that could cause cycles: e.g., \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\", \"Alice -> Michelle\", \"Michelle -> Betty\", \"Betty -> Hannah\", \"Hannah -> Daniel\", \"Daniel -> Margaret\", \"Margaret -> Judy\", \"Judy -> Christina\", \"Christina -> Bradley\", \"Bradley -> Ralph\", \"Ralph -> Jack\", \"Jack -> Eugene\", \"Eugene -> Samantha\", \"Samantha -> George\", \"George -> Terry\", \"Terry -> Charlotte\", \"Charlotte -> Carol\", \"Carol -> Patricia\", \"Patricia -> Bryan\", \"Bryan -> Ryan\", \"Ryan -> Amanda\", \"Amanda -> Kenneth\", \"Kenneth -> Arthur\", \"Arthur -> (none)\". So that chain leads to Arthur.\n\nNow also \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\". Also \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\". \"Alice -> Michelle\". So chain continues.\n\nNow also \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\". \"Alice -> Michelle\". \"Michelle -> Betty\". \"Betty -> Hannah\". \"Hannah -> Daniel\". \"Daniel -> Margaret\". \"Margaret -> Judy\". \"Judy -> Christina\". \"Christina -> Bradley\". \"Bradley -> Ralph\". \"Ralph -> Jack\". \"Jack -> Eugene\". \"Eugene -> Samantha\". \"Samantha -> George\". \"George -> Terry\". \"Terry -> Charlotte\". \"Charlotte -> Carol\". \"Carol -> Patricia\". \"Patricia -> Bryan\". \"Bryan -> Ryan\". \"Ryan -> Amanda\". \"Amanda -> Kenneth\". \"Kenneth -> Arthur\". So this chain goes from Austin to Arthur.\n\nNow also \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\". Also \"Alice -> Michelle\". So that's part.\n\nNow also \"Austin -> Douglas\" and \"Douglas -> Alice\". Also \"Austin -> Douglas\" is from Rachel -> Austin. So \"Rachel -> Austin -> Douglas -> Alice -> Michelle -> ...\" So chain continues.\n\nThus the chain from Shirley includes the same chain after Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, ... So indeed the chain from Shirley merges with the chain from Madison at Arthur. So the graph is a directed tree merging at Arthur. So the only common descendant of Madison and Shirley is Arthur.\n\nThus answer: \"Madison and Shirley share a common descendant.\"\n\nThus option 4.\n\nBut we need to verify if any other node is also a common descendant. Could there be a node that is descendant of both Madison and Shirley besides Arthur? Let's see if any node appears in both reachable sets.\n\nFrom Madison, reachable set includes: Madison, Harold, Jordan, Noah, Timothy, Matthew, Mary, Janet, Katherine, Dorothy, Brandon, Anthony, Mason, James, Karen, Brian, Lawrence, Marie, Joan, Joyce, Melissa, Aaron, Doris, Richard, Jose, Alexander, Andrea, Arthur. Also includes all descendants of Arthur? Arthur has no children. So only those.\n\nFrom Shirley, reachable set includes: Shirley, Evelyn, Theresa, Peter, Barbara, Nicole, Elijah, Kevin, Sophia, Scott, Donald, Rachel, Austin, Douglas, Alice, Michelle, Betty, Hannah, Daniel, Margaret, Judy, Christina, Bradley, Ralph, Jack, Eugene, Samantha, George, Terry, Charlotte, Carol, Patricia, Bryan, Ryan, Amanda, Kenneth, Arthur. Also includes all descendants of Arthur? None.\n\nThus the only common node is Arthur.\n\nThus answer is 4.\n\nNow check if there is any possibility that the relationship is \"Madison is Shirley's ancestor\" or \"Shirley is Madison's ancestor\"? No, because no path from Madison to Shirley or vice versa.\n\nThus answer is 4.\n\nNow ensure the answer format: <ANSWER>4</ANSWER>.\n\nThus final answer: <ANSWER>4</ANSWER>."}]}}],"usage":{"total_tokens":13143,"total_characters":0,"prompt_tokens":569,"completion_tokens":12574,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":12797}}}
