**Matthew** is a direct descendant of **Logan** through this lineage. However, the question asks about the relationship between **Matthew** and **Logan**. The correct answer depends on the interpretation of the chain:  
- If the chain is strictly linear, **Matthew** is **Logan's descendant** (option 1).  
- However, the phrasing ""lineage relationship"" might imply broader family connections. If Logan and Matthew share a common ancestor not explicitly stated (e.g., if Logan has other descendants besides Benjamin), this could introduce ambiguity.  

Given the provided relationships, the direct lineage implies **Matthew is Logan's descendant** (option 1). Yet, since the problem does not explicitly confirm a direct parent-child link between all generations (only descendant/ancestor relationships), it’s possible the answer expects ""None of the above"" (option 5) due to insufficient explicit confirmation of the exact generational path.

   - Hannah is Amber's ancestor.

2. **Alexander's Lineage**:  
   - Alexander is Emily's descendant.  
   The problem does not specify Alexander’s exact position in the lineage, but he must be connected to Emily.

**Key Observations**:  
- **Keith** is a descendant of **Emily** through the chain: **Emily → Beverly → Hannah → Amber → Dorothy → Doris → Keith**.  
- **Alexander** is also a descendant of **Emily**, though his exact branch isn’t detailed.  

Since both Keith and Alexander trace their ancestry back to **Emily**, they share **Emily** as a **common ancestor**. The problem does not indicate that Keith is Alexander’s direct ancestor or descendant, nor does it mention a shared descendant. Thus, the correct relationship is that **Keith and Alexander share a common ancestor (Emily)**.

1. **Maria → Eric → Rachel → Stephanie → Willie → Ann → Doris**  
   This chain shows Doris's lineage descending from Maria through Eric, Rachel, Stephanie, Willie, and Ann.

2. **Maria → Katherine**  
   Katherine is also a descendant of Maria, but her exact position isn't specified further. She could be part of a separate branch under Maria (e.g., a sibling or cousin to Eric's line).

**Key Observations**:
- Both Katherine and Doris are descendants of Maria.
- Katherine is not mentioned in the lineage chain leading to Doris (Maria → Eric → Rachel → Stephanie → Willie → Ann → Doris), indicating she belongs to a different branch of Maria's descendants.
- There is no information suggesting Katherine is an ancestor or descendant of Doris, nor do they share a common descendant.

**Conclusion**: Katherine and Doris share Maria as their **common ancestor**. However, none of the options explicitly state this relationship. While option 1 (""share a common ancestor"") seems plausible, the problem's phrasing might implicitly require a more direct relationship not covered by the options. Thus, **none of the provided answers fully align with the inferred relationships**.

2. **Melissa → Philip** (since Philip is Melissa's descendant).  

To connect Melissa to Bobby's lineage, Robert (Bobby's descendant) must be Melissa's ancestor for Philip to be a descendant of both Robert and Melissa. This implies **Melissa is part of Bobby's lineage**, specifically as a descendant of Robert. Thus, Melissa is Bobby's descendant.

**Key Observations**:
- Sandra is a descendant of **both** Michael (via the chain Michael → Charlotte → Christian → Aaron → Kelly → Marie → Sandra) and Douglas (via Douglas → Sandra).  
- This makes Sandra a **common descendant** of Michael and Douglas.  

**Evaluation of Options**:
1. **Common Ancestor**: No shared ancestor is indicated between Michael and Douglas.  
2. **Michael as Douglas's Descendant**: No direct or indirect lineage supports this.  
3. **Michael as Douglas's Ancestor**: No evidence suggests Michael is in Douglas's lineage.  
4. **Common Descendant**: Sandra is explicitly a descendant of both, confirming this option.  
5. **None of the Above**: Incorrect, as option 4 is valid.  

Thus, Michael and Douglas **share a common descendant (Sandra)**.
