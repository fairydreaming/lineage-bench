1. **Bradley's Lineage:**
   - Elizabeth is Bradley's ancestor.
   - Brenda is Elizabeth's ancestor.

   - Brenda is Bryan's descendant.

   From these relationships, we can infer:
   - Elizabeth -> Bradley (ancestor)
   - Brenda -> Elizabeth (ancestor)
   - Jean -> Bryan (ancestor)
   - Brenda -> Bryan (descendant)

   Therefore, the lineage for Bradley is: Jean -> Bryan -> Brenda -> Elizabeth -> Bradley.

2. **Sara's Lineage:**
   - Sara is Jacob's ancestor.
   - Diane is Jacob's descendant.
   - Edward is Brian's ancestor.

   From these relationships, we can infer:
   - Sara -> Jacob (ancestor)
   - Diane -> Jacob (descendant)
   - Edward -> Brian (ancestor)
   - Diane -> Edward (ancestor)

   Therefore, the lineage for Sara is: Sara -> Jacob -> Diane -> Edward -> Brian.

- Sean's ancestors are Frances and Joseph.

There is no direct connection mentioned between Albert and Frances or Joseph. Therefore, Theresa and Sean do not share a direct ancestor-descendant relationship.

Next, let's check if they share a common ancestor or descendant.

- Theresa's lineage does not connect to Frances or Joseph.
- Sean's lineage does not connect to Albert.

Since there is no direct connection and no shared ancestor or descendant mentioned, the correct answer is:

**5. None of the above is correct.**

1. **Amber's Lineage:**
   - Sophia is Amber's descendant.
   - Cheryl is Tyler's descendant.
   - Sophia is Tyler's ancestor.

   From these, we can infer that Amber is an ancestor of Tyler, and Sophia is a descendant of Amber.

2. **Matthew's Lineage:**
   - Matthew is Albert's ancestor.
   - Sharon is Carolyn's ancestor.
   - Albert is Sharon's ancestor.

   From these, we can infer that Matthew is an ancestor of Sharon, and Albert is a descendant of Matthew.

Now, let's see if there is any connection between Amber and Matthew through their descendants or ancestors.

- **Amber's Descendants:**
  - Tyler (through Sophia)

- **Matthew's Descendants:**
  - Sharon (through Albert)

There is no direct connection between Amber's descendants and Matthew's descendants in the given relationships. Therefore, Amber and Matthew do not share a common descendant.

Next, let's check if they share a common ancestor.

- **Amber's Ancestors:**
  - No direct ancestors of Amber are mentioned.

- **Matthew's Ancestors:**
  - No direct ancestors of Matthew are mentioned.

Since there is no information linking Amber and Matthew through a common ancestor or descendant, the correct answer is:

1. **Identify Russell's lineage:**
   - Kyle is Russell's descendant.
   - Randy is Kyle's descendant.
   - Lisa is Randy's descendant.
   - Logan is Lisa's descendant.
   - Judy is Logan's descendant.
   - Lawrence is Judy's descendant.

   Therefore, the lineage for Russell is: Russell → Kyle → Randy → Lisa → Logan → Judy → Lawrence.

2. **Identify Diana's lineage:**
   - Diana is Nancy's ancestor.

   - Abigail is Frances's descendant.
   - Kathryn is Abigail's descendant.
   - Rachel is Kathryn's descendant.
   - David is Rachel's descendant.
   - Evelyn is David's descendant.
   - Adam is Evelyn's descendant.

   Therefore, the lineage for Diana is: Diana → Nancy → Frances → Abigail → Kathryn → Rachel → David → Evelyn → Adam.

3. **Check for common ancestors or descendants:**
   - Russell's lineage ends with Lawrence.
   - Diana's lineage ends with Adam.

   There are no common individuals in their direct lineages, so they do not share a common ancestor or descendant directly.

   - Shirley is Joseph's ancestor.
   - Joseph is Gregory's descendant.
   - Joan is Gregory's ancestor.
   - Joan is Christine's descendant.
   - Ann is Christine's ancestor.
   - Natalie is Ann's ancestor.

   Therefore, Lawrence's lineage can be extended to: Lawrence → Kenneth → Shirley → Joseph → Gregory → Joan → Christine → Ann → Natalie.
