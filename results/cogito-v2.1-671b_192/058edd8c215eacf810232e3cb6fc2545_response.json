(Assuming \"Linda is Mary's ancestor\" is correct, but the original says \"Linda is Mary's ancestor\" but earlier it says \"Mary is Adam's ancestor.\" So Linda is Mary's ancestor, and Mary is Adam's ancestor, so Linda is Adam's ancestor as well.\n\nBut let's get back to Roy.

(From \"Janice is Stephanie's ancestor.\")\n- Stephanie is Adam's ancestor. (From \"Stephanie is Adam's ancestor.\")\n- Adam is Mary's descendant. (From \"Mary is Adam's ancestor.\") Wait, \"Mary is Adam's ancestor\" means Adam is Mary's descendant.\n\nSo, Roy's lineage goes: Roy -> Justin -> ... -> Adam -> Mary -> ... -> Linda -> Virginia -> ... -> Paul -> ... -> Joe? Wait, no, let's see if there's a connection.\n\nFrom Joe's side, we have Joe -> Roger -> Russell -> ... -> Linda -> Mary -> Adam -> Stephanie -> Janice -> Gloria -> Kenneth -> Edward -> Thomas -> Raymond -> Billy -> Vincent -> Kimberly -> Sophia -> Justin -> Roy.\n\nWait, that would mean Joe is an ancestor of Roy.
