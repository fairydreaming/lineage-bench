(So Kimberly is an ancestor of Katherine, and thus of Alexis)\n\nNow, is there any connection from Kimberly to Christian? Let's see if Kimberly is mentioned elsewhere.\n\nLooking for Kimberly:\n- Madison is Kimberly's ancestor. (So Kimberly is a descendant of Madison)\n- Timothy is Madison's ancestor.

For example, is there a relationship that connects one of these to a common person?\n\nAlternatively, maybe through the fact that both have ancestors/descendants listed, but no direct link.\n\nWait, let's check if there's any relationship that connects Katherine or Alexis to Christian or Virginia.\n\nFor example, is there a relationship that says something like \"X is Christian's ancestor\" or \"X is Alexis's descendant\"?\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any other mentions of Alexis or Christian.\n\nSo, based on the given information, there is no direct lineage between Alexis and Christian, and no common ancestor or descendant is indicated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"None of the above is correct.\"\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any connection.\n\nAnother approach: list all ancestors of Alexis and see if any of them are connected to Christian.\n\nAlexis's ancestors:\n- Katherine (direct ancestor)\n- Kimberly (ancestor of Katherine)\n- Madison (ancestor of Kimberly)\n- Timothy (ancestor of Madison)\n- Gloria (ancestor of Timothy)\n- Willie (ancestor of Gloria)\n\nNow, are any of these (Katherine, Kimberly, Madison, Timothy, Gloria, Willie) connected to Christian or his descendants?\n\nChristian's descendants:\n- Virginia\n- Melissa (descendant of Virginia)\n- Jeremy (descendant of Melissa)\n- etc.\n\nNo overlap in names.\n\nIs there any relationship that connects Willie to someone in Christian's line? For example, is Willie an ancestor of someone who is connected to Christian?\n\nLooking at Willie: only mentioned as Gloria's ancestor.
