1. **Rebecca is Barbara's ancestor.**
   - This means Rebecca is higher in the lineage than Barbara.

2. **Gregory is Barbara's descendant.**
   - This means Gregory is lower in the lineage than Barbara, and therefore also lower than Rebecca (since Rebecca is Barbara's ancestor).

3. **Philip is Betty's ancestor.**
   - This means Philip is higher in the lineage than Betty.

4. **Matthew is Philip's ancestor.**
   - This means Matthew is higher in the lineage than Philip, and therefore also higher than Betty (since Philip is Betty's ancestor).

5. **Jessica is Danielle's descendant.**
   - This means Jessica is lower in the lineage than Danielle.

6. **Gregory is Jessica's ancestor.**
   - This means Gregory is higher in the lineage than Jessica, and therefore also higher than Danielle (since Jessica is Danielle's descendant).

7. **Danielle is Betty's descendant.**
   - This means Danielle is lower in the lineage than Betty.

### Combining the relationships:
- From (4) and (7), Matthew is higher in the lineage than Philip, who is higher than Betty, who is higher than Danielle.
- From (6), Gregory is higher than Jessica, who is lower than Danielle.
- From (1) and (2), Rebecca is higher than Barbara, who is lower than Gregory.

Thus:
- Matthew is higher in the lineage than Betty, Danielle, and Jessica.
- Rebecca is higher in the lineage than Barbara, Gregory, Jessica, and Danielle.

Since both Matthew and Rebecca are at the top of their respective lineages, **there is no direct ancestor/descendant relationship between them. However, they share common descendants (e.g., Danielle, Jessica, Gregory, etc.).**

1. **Nicholas is Gloria's ancestor.**
   - This means Nicholas is higher in the lineage than Gloria.

2. **Jacqueline is Gloria's descendant.**
   - This means Jacqueline is lower in the lineage than Gloria, and therefore lower than Nicholas as well.

3. **Ronald is Harold's descendant.**
   - This means Ronald is lower in the lineage than Harold.

4. **Kelly is Andrew's descendant.**
   - This means Kelly is lower in the lineage than Andrew.

5. **Kelly is Harold's ancestor.**
   - This means Kelly is higher in the lineage than Harold, and therefore higher than Ronald (since Ronald is Harold's descendant).

6. **Ronald is Noah's ancestor.**
   - This means Ronald is higher in the lineage than Noah.

7. **Jacqueline is Noah's descendant.**
   - This means Jacqueline is lower in the lineage than Noah, and therefore lower than Ronald (since Ronald is Noah's ancestor).

From the above, we can deduce:
- Nicholas is at the top of the lineage involving Gloria, Jacqueline, and Noah.
- Andrew is higher in the lineage than Kelly, who is higher than Harold, who is higher than Ronald, who is higher than Noah.
- Since Jacqueline is Noah's descendant, Jacqueline is also lower in the lineage than Andrew.

Thus, Nicholas is higher in the lineage than Andrew, making **Nicholas an ancestor of Andrew**.
