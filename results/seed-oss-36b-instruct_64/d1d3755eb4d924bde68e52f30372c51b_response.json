First, I need to list out all the information given and see if we can connect Judith's line to Deborah's line. Let's start by writing down what we know about Judith first, then Deborah, and see if there's a path between them.\n\nStarting with Judith: The first statement is \"Gary is Judith's descendant.\" So Judith → ... → Gary. Then later, \"Ann is Gary's descendant.\" So Judith → ... → Gary → ... → Ann. Ann is also \"Joseph's ancestor,\" so Ann → ... → Joseph. Joseph is \"Ethan's ancestor,\" so Joseph → ... → Ethan. Ethan is \"Bobby's ancestor,\" so Ethan → ... → Bobby. Dorothy is \"Bobby's descendant\" (Dorothy is Julie's ancestor, Margaret is Julie's descendant, Frank is Margaret's descendant, etc., but maybe focus on Bobby's line: Bobby → ... → Dorothy). Also, Ethan is connected to Bobby, but let's check if there's another path from Judith. Wait, do we have more on Judith's side? Let's see: Ann is Gary's descendant, Joseph's ancestor, so that's Judith → Gary → Ann → Joseph → Ethan → Bobby. Any other lines from Judith? Maybe not yet. Let's move to Deborah.\n\nDeborah: \"Deborah is Edward's descendant.\" So Edward → ... → Deborah. Then, \"Edward is Jordan's descendant\" (Edward is Jordan's descendant), so Jordan → ... → Edward → ... → Deborah. Jordan is also \"Alice's descendant\" (Jordan is Alice's descendant), and Brittany is \"Alice's ancestor\" (Brittany → ... → Alice → ... → Jordan → ... → Edward → ... → Deborah).

Margaret is \"Julie's descendant\" (Margaret is Julie's descendant), so Julie → ... → Margaret → ... → Deborah. Dorothy is \"Julie's ancestor\" (Dorothy → ... → Julie), so Dorothy → ... → Deborah.

Wait, so Dorothy is an ancestor of Julie, who is an ancestor of Margaret, etc., which leads to Deborah. And Dorothy is a descendant of Bobby, who is a descendant of Ethan, who is a descendant of Joseph, who is a descendant of Ann, who is a descendant of Gary, who is a descendant of Judith. So that means Judith is an ancestor of Dorothy, and Dorothy is an ancestor of Deborah. Therefore, Judith would be an ancestor of Deborah? Wait, let's check that again step by step to make sure I didn't mix up ancestor/descendant.\n\nAncestor: If A is B's ancestor, then B is A's descendant (A → ... → B). So \"Gary is Judith's descendant\" means Judith is Gary's ancestor (Judith → ... → Gary). \"Ann is Gary's descendant\" means Gary → ... → Ann, so Judith → ... → Gary → ... → Ann (Judith is Ann's ancestor). \"Ann is Joseph's ancestor\" → Ann → ... → Joseph, so Judith → ... → Joseph. \"Joseph is Ethan's ancestor\" → Joseph → ... → Ethan, so Judith → ... → Ethan. \"Ethan is Bobby's ancestor\" → Ethan → ... → Bobby, so Judith → ... → Bobby. \"Dorothy is Bobby's descendant\" → Bobby → ... → Dorothy, so Judith → ... → Dorothy (so Judith is Dorothy's ancestor). Now Deborah's line: \"Dorothy is Julie's ancestor\" → Dorothy → ... → Julie, so Judith → ... → Julie. \"Margaret is Julie's descendant\" → Julie → ... → Margaret, so Judith → ... → Margaret. \"Frank is Margaret's descendant\" → Margaret → ... → Frank, Judith → ... → Frank. \"Frank is Amanda's ancestor\" → Frank → ... → Amanda, Judith → ... → Amanda. \"Diane is Amanda's descendant\" → Amanda → ... → Diane, Judith → ... → Diane. \"Christine is Diane's descendant\" → Diane → ... → Christine, Judith → ... → Christine. \"Wayne is Christine's descendant\" → Christine → ... → Wayne, Judith → ... → Wayne. \"Wayne is Elijah's ancestor\" → Wayne → ... → Elijah, Judith → ... → Elijah. \"Elijah is Samuel's ancestor\" → Elijah → ... → Samuel, Judith → ... → Samuel. \"Samuel is Roger's ancestor\" → Samuel → ... → Roger, Judith → ... → Roger. \"Roger is Abigail's ancestor\" → Roger → ... → Abigail, Judith → ... → Abigail. \"George is Abigail's descendant\" → Abigail → ... → George, Judith → ... → George. \"George is Harold's ancestor\" → George → ... → Harold, Judith → ... → Harold. \"Harold is Kayla's ancestor\" → Harold → ... → Kayla, Judith → ... → Kayla. \"Kayla is Philip's ancestor\" → Kayla → ... → Philip, Judith → ... → Philip. \"Matthew is Philip's descendant\" → Philip → ... → Matthew, Judith → ... → Matthew. \"Matthew is Grace's ancestor\" → Matthew → ... → Grace, Judith → ... → Grace. \"Grace is Janet's ancestor\" → Grace → ... → Janet, Judith → ... → Janet. \"Janet is Nathan's ancestor\" → Janet → ... → Nathan, Judith → ... → Nathan. \"Zachary is Nathan's descendant\" → Nathan → ... → Zachary, Judith → ... → Zachary. \"Megan is Zachary's descendant\" → Zachary → ... → Megan, Judith → ... → Megan. \"Megan is Douglas's ancestor\" → Megan → ... → Douglas, Judith → ... → Douglas. \"Douglas is Jose's ancestor\" → Douglas → ... → Jose, Judith → ... → Jose. \"Austin is Jose's descendant\" → Jose → ... → Austin, Judith → ... → Austin. \"Cheryl is Austin's descendant\" → Austin → ... → Cheryl, Judith → ... → Cheryl. \"Elizabeth is Cheryl's descendant\" → Cheryl → ... → Elizabeth, Judith → ... → Elizabeth. \"Kathleen is Elizabeth's descendant\" → Elizabeth → ... → Kathleen, Judith → ... → Kathleen. \"William is Kathleen's descendant\" → Kathleen → ... → William, Judith → ... → William. \"John is William's descendant\" → William → ... → John, Judith → ... → John. \"John is Beverly's ancestor\" → John → ... → Beverly, Judith → ... → Beverly. \"Eric is Beverly's descendant\" → Beverly → ... → Eric, Judith → ... → Eric. \"Eric is Patrick's ancestor\" → Eric → ... → Patrick, Judith → ... → Patrick. \"Patrick is Joyce's ancestor\" → Patrick → ... → Joyce, Judith → ... → Joyce. \"Joyce is Hannah's ancestor\" → Joyce → ... → Hannah, Judith → ... → Hannah. \"Hannah is Gloria's ancestor\" → Hannah → ... → Gloria, Judith → ... → Gloria. \"Gloria is Christian's ancestor\" → Gloria → ... → Christian, Judith → ... → Christian. \"Christian is Ruth's ancestor\"? Wait no: \"Ruth is Christian's descendant\" → Christian → ... → Ruth, so Judith → ... → Ruth. \"Bryan is Ruth's descendant\" → Ruth → ... → Bryan, Judith → ... → Bryan. \"Bryan is Gerald's ancestor\" → Bryan → ... → Gerald, Judith → ... → Gerald. \"Gerald is Sarah's ancestor\" → Gerald → ... → Sarah, Judith → ... → Sarah. \"Sarah is Russell's ancestor\" → Sarah → ... → Russell, Judith → ... → Russell. \"Russell is Denise's ancestor\" → Russell → ... → Denise, Judith → ... → Denise. \"Emily is Denise's descendant\" → Denise → ... → Emily, Judith → ... → Emily. \"Lauren is Emily's descendant\" → Emily → ... → Lauren, Judith → ... → Lauren. \"Henry is Lauren's descendant\" → Lauren → ... → Henry, Judith → ... → Henry. \"Henry is Michelle's ancestor\" → Henry → ... → Michelle, Judith → ... → Michelle. \"Michelle is Jesse's ancestor\" → Michelle → ... → Jesse, Judith → ... → Jesse. \"Shirley is Jesse's descendant\" → Jesse → ... → Shirley, Judith → ... → Shirley. \"Shirley is Patricia's ancestor\" → Shirley → ... → Patricia, Judith → ... → Patricia. \"Jason is Patricia's descendant\" → Patricia → ... → Jason, Judith → ... → Jason. \"Robert is Jason's descendant\" → Jason → ... → Robert, Judith → ... → Robert. \"Robert is Amy's ancestor\" → Robert → ... → Amy, Judith → ... → Amy. \"Brittany is Amy's descendant\" → Amy → ... → Brittany, Judith → ... → Brittany. \"Brittany is Alice's ancestor\" → Brittany → ... → Alice, Judith → ... → Alice. \"Jordan is Alice's descendant\" → Alice → ... → Jordan, Judith → ... → Jordan. \"Edward is Jordan's descendant\" → Jordan → ... → Edward, Judith → ... → Edward. \"Deborah is Edward's descendant\" → Edward → ... → Deborah. Oh! So putting that all together, Judith is an ancestor of Edward, and Edward is an ancestor of Deborah, so Judith is Deborah's ancestor? Wait, is that right? Let me confirm the key links again to make sure I didn't reverse any.\n\nJudith ← ancestor → Gary (Gary is Judith's descendant: Judith is ancestor of Gary) → Ann (Ann is Gary's descendant: Gary ancestor of Ann, so Judith ancestor of Ann) → Joseph (Ann ancestor of Joseph: Judith ancestor of Joseph) → Ethan (Joseph ancestor of Ethan: Judith ancestor of Ethan) → Bobby (Ethan ancestor of Bobby: Judith ancestor of Bobby) → Dorothy (Dorothy is Bobby's descendant: Bobby ancestor of Dorothy, so Judith ancestor of Dorothy) → Julie (Dorothy is Julie's ancestor: Dorothy ancestor of Julie, Judith ancestor of Julie) → Margaret (Margaret is Julie's descendant: Judith ancestor of Margaret) → Frank (Frank is Margaret's descendant: Judith ancestor of Frank) → Amanda (Frank is Amanda's ancestor: Frank ancestor of Amanda, Judith ancestor of Amanda) → Diane (Diane is Amanda's descendant: Judith ancestor of Diane) → Christine (Christine is Diane's descendant: Judith ancestor of Christine) → Wayne (Wayne is Christine's descendant: Judith ancestor of Wayne) → Elijah (Wayne is Elijah's ancestor: Wayne ancestor of Elijah, Judith ancestor of Elijah) → Samuel (Elijah is Samuel's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Samuel) → Roger (Samuel is Roger's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Roger) → Abigail (Roger is Abigail's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Abigail) → George (George is Abigail's descendant: Judith ancestor of George) → Harold (George is Harold's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Harold) → Kayla (Harold is Kayla's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Kayla) → Philip (Kayla is Philip's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Philip) → Matthew (Matthew is Philip's descendant: Judith ancestor of Matthew) → Grace (Matthew is Grace's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Grace) → Janet (Grace is Janet's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Janet) → Nathan (Janet is Nathan's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Nathan) → Zachary (Zachary is Nathan's descendant: Judith ancestor of Zachary) → Megan (Megan is Zachary's descendant: Judith ancestor of Megan) → Douglas (Megan is Douglas's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Douglas) → Jose (Douglas is Jose's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Jose) → Austin (Austin is Jose's descendant: Judith ancestor of Austin) → Cheryl (Cheryl is Austin's descendant: Judith ancestor of Cheryl) → Elizabeth (Elizabeth is Cheryl's descendant: Judith ancestor of Elizabeth) → Kathleen (Kathleen is Elizabeth's descendant: Judith ancestor of Kathleen) → William (William is Kathleen's descendant: Judith ancestor of William) → John (John is William's descendant: Judith ancestor of John) → Beverly (John is Beverly's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Beverly) → Eric (Eric is Beverly's descendant: Judith ancestor of Eric) → Patrick (Eric is Patrick's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Patrick) → Joyce (Patrick is Joyce's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Joyce) → Hannah (Joyce is Hannah's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Hannah) → Gloria (Hannah is Gloria's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Gloria) → Christian (Gloria is Christian's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Christian) → Ruth (Ruth is Christian's descendant: Judith ancestor of Ruth) → Bryan (Bryan is Ruth's descendant: Judith ancestor of Bryan) → Gerald (Bryan is Gerald's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Gerald) → Sarah (Gerald is Sarah's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Sarah) → Russell (Sarah is Russell's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Russell) → Denise (Russell is Denise's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Denise) → Emily (Emily is Denise's descendant: Judith ancestor of Emily) → Lauren (Lauren is Emily's descendant: Judith ancestor of Lauren) → Henry (Henry is Lauren's descendant: Judith ancestor of Henry) → Michelle (Henry is Michelle's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Michelle) → Jesse (Michelle is Jesse's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Jesse) → Shirley (Shirley is Jesse's descendant: Judith ancestor of Shirley) → Patricia (Shirley is Patricia's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Patricia) → Jason (Jason is Patricia's descendant: Judith ancestor of Jason) → Robert (Robert is Jason's descendant: Judith ancestor of Robert) → Amy (Robert is Amy's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Amy) → Brittany (Brittany is Amy's descendant: Judith ancestor of Brittany) → Alice (Brittany is Alice's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Alice) → Jordan (Jordan is Alice's descendant: Judith ancestor of Jordan) → Edward (Edward is Jordan's descendant: Judith ancestor of Edward) → Deborah (Deborah is Edward's descendant: Edward ancestor of Deborah, so Judith ancestor of Deborah). \n\nWow, so that's a long chain, but every step checks out. So Judith is Deborah's ancestor? Let me make sure there's no mistake in direction. The problem says \"Gary is Judith's descendant\" – so Judith is an ancestor of Gary, correct. Then \"Ann is Gary's descendant\" – Gary is ancestor of Ann, so Judith is ancestor of Ann. Then Ann is Joseph's ancestor, so Judith → Ann → Joseph, so Judith is Joseph's ancestor. Ethan is Joseph's descendant? No: \"Joseph is Ethan's ancestor\" – so Joseph → Ethan, so Judith → Ethan. Ethan is Bobby's ancestor: Ethan → Bobby, Judith → Bobby.

So \"Gary is Judith's descendant\" means Judith is Gary's ancestor (Judith → ... → Gary). \"Ann is Gary's descendant\" means Gary → ... → Ann, so Judith → ... → Gary → ... → Ann (Judith is Ann's ancestor). \"Ann is Joseph's ancestor\" → Ann → ... → Joseph, so Judith → ... → Joseph. \"Joseph is Ethan's ancestor\" → Joseph → ... → Ethan, so Judith → ... → Ethan. \"Ethan is Bobby's ancestor\" → Ethan → ... → Bobby, so Judith → ... → Bobby. \"Dorothy is Bobby's descendant\" → Bobby → ... → Dorothy, so Judith → ... → Dorothy (so Judith is Dorothy's ancestor). Now Deborah's line: \"Dorothy is Julie's ancestor\" → Dorothy → ... → Julie, so Judith → ... → Julie. \"Margaret is Julie's descendant\" → Julie → ... → Margaret, so Judith → ... → Margaret. \"Frank is Margaret's descendant\" → Margaret → ... → Frank, Judith → ... → Frank. \"Frank is Amanda's ancestor\" → Frank → ... → Amanda, Judith → ... → Amanda. \"Diane is Amanda's descendant\" → Amanda → ... → Diane, Judith → ... → Diane. \"Christine is Diane's descendant\" → Diane → ... → Christine, Judith → ... → Christine. \"Wayne is Christine's descendant\" → Christine → ... → Wayne, Judith → ... → Wayne. \"Wayne is Elijah's ancestor\" → Wayne → ... → Elijah, Judith → ... → Elijah. \"Elijah is Samuel's ancestor\" → Elijah → ... → Samuel, Judith → ... → Samuel. \"Samuel is Roger's ancestor\" → Samuel → ... → Roger, Judith → ... → Roger. \"Roger is Abigail's ancestor\" → Roger → ... → Abigail, Judith → ... → Abigail. \"George is Abigail's descendant\" → Abigail → ... → George, Judith → ... → George. \"George is Harold's ancestor\" → George → ... → Harold, Judith → ... → Harold. \"Harold is Kayla's ancestor\" → Harold → ... → Kayla, Judith → ... → Kayla. \"Kayla is Philip's ancestor\" → Kayla → ... → Philip, Judith → ... → Philip. \"Matthew is Philip's descendant\" → Philip → ... → Matthew, Judith → ... → Matthew. \"Matthew is Grace's ancestor\" → Matthew → ... → Grace, Judith → ... → Grace. \"Grace is Janet's ancestor\" → Grace → ... → Janet, Judith → ... → Janet. \"Janet is Nathan's ancestor\" → Janet → ... → Nathan, Judith → ... → Nathan. \"Zachary is Nathan's descendant\" → Nathan → ... → Zachary, Judith → ... → Zachary. \"Megan is Zachary's descendant\" → Zachary → ... → Megan, Judith → ... → Megan. \"Megan is Douglas's ancestor\" → Megan → ... → Douglas, Judith → ... → Douglas. \"Douglas is Jose's ancestor\" → Douglas → ... → Jose, Judith → ... → Jose. \"Austin is Jose's descendant\" → Jose → ... → Austin, Judith → ... → Austin. \"Cheryl is Austin's descendant\" → Austin → ... → Cheryl, Judith → ... → Cheryl. \"Elizabeth is Cheryl's descendant\" → Cheryl → ... → Elizabeth, Judith → ... → Elizabeth. \"Kathleen is Elizabeth's descendant\" → Elizabeth → ... → Kathleen, Judith → ... → Kathleen. \"William is Kathleen's descendant\" → Kathleen → ... → William, Judith → ... → William. \"John is William's descendant\" → William → ... → John, Judith → ... → John. \"John is Beverly's ancestor\" → John → ... → Beverly, Judith → ... → Beverly. \"Eric is Beverly's descendant\" → Beverly → ... → Eric, Judith → ... → Eric. \"Eric is Patrick's ancestor\" → Eric → ... → Patrick, Judith → ... → Patrick. \"Patrick is Joyce's ancestor\" → Patrick → ... → Joyce, Judith → ... → Joyce. \"Joyce is Hannah's ancestor\" → Joyce → ... → Hannah, Judith → ... → Hannah. \"Hannah is Gloria's ancestor\" → Hannah → ... → Gloria, Judith → ... → Gloria. \"Gloria is Christian's ancestor\" → Gloria → ... → Christian, Judith → ... → Christian. \"Christian is Ruth's ancestor\"? Wait no: \"Ruth is Christian's descendant\" → Christian → ... → Ruth, so Judith → ... → Ruth. \"Bryan is Ruth's descendant\" → Ruth → ... → Bryan, Judith → ... → Bryan. \"Bryan is Gerald's ancestor\" → Bryan → ... → Gerald, Judith → ... → Gerald. \"Gerald is Sarah's ancestor\" → Gerald → ... → Sarah, Judith → ... → Sarah. \"Sarah is Russell's ancestor\" → Sarah → ... → Russell, Judith → ... → Russell. \"Russell is Denise's ancestor\" → Russell → ... → Denise, Judith → ... → Denise. \"Emily is Denise's descendant\" → Denise → ... → Emily, Judith → ... → Emily. \"Lauren is Emily's descendant\" → Emily → ... → Lauren, Judith → ... → Lauren. \"Henry is Lauren's descendant\" → Lauren → ... → Henry, Judith → ... → Henry. \"Henry is Michelle's ancestor\" → Henry → ... → Michelle, Judith → ... → Michelle. \"Michelle is Jesse's ancestor\" → Michelle → ... → Jesse, Judith → ... → Jesse. \"Shirley is Jesse's descendant\" → Jesse → ... → Shirley, Judith → ... → Shirley. \"Shirley is Patricia's ancestor\" → Shirley → ... → Patricia, Judith → ... → Patricia. \"Jason is Patricia's descendant\" → Patricia → ... → Jason, Judith → ... → Jason. \"Robert is Jason's descendant\" → Jason → ... → Robert, Judith → ... → Robert. \"Robert is Amy's ancestor\" → Robert → ... → Amy, Judith → ... → Amy. \"Brittany is Amy's descendant\" → Amy → ... → Brittany, Judith → ... → Brittany. \"Brittany is Alice's ancestor\" → Brittany → ... → Alice, Judith → ... → Alice. \"Jordan is Alice's descendant\" → Alice → ... → Jordan, Judith → ... → Jordan. \"Edward is Jordan's descendant\" → Jordan → ... → Edward, Judith → ... → Edward. \"Deborah is Edward's descendant\" → Edward → ... → Deborah. Oh! So putting that all together, Judith is an ancestor of Edward, and Edward is an ancestor of Deborah, so Judith is Deborah's ancestor? Wait, is that right? Let me confirm the key links again to make sure I didn't reverse any.\n\nJudith ← ancestor → Gary (Gary is Judith's descendant: Judith is ancestor of Gary) → Ann (Ann is Gary's descendant: Gary ancestor of Ann, so Judith ancestor of Ann) → Joseph (Ann ancestor of Joseph: Judith ancestor of Joseph) → Ethan (Joseph ancestor of Ethan: Judith ancestor of Ethan) → Bobby (Ethan ancestor of Bobby: Judith ancestor of Bobby) → Dorothy (Dorothy is Bobby's descendant: Bobby ancestor of Dorothy, so Judith ancestor of Dorothy) → Julie (Dorothy is Julie's ancestor: Dorothy ancestor of Julie, Judith ancestor of Julie) → Margaret (Margaret is Julie's descendant: Judith ancestor of Margaret) → Frank (Frank is Margaret's descendant: Judith ancestor of Frank) → Amanda (Frank is Amanda's ancestor: Frank ancestor of Amanda, Judith ancestor of Amanda) → Diane (Diane is Amanda's descendant: Judith ancestor of Diane) → Christine (Christine is Diane's descendant: Judith ancestor of Christine) → Wayne (Wayne is Christine's descendant: Judith ancestor of Wayne) → Elijah (Wayne is Elijah's ancestor: Wayne ancestor of Elijah, Judith ancestor of Elijah) → Samuel (Elijah is Samuel's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Samuel) → Roger (Samuel is Roger's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Roger) → Abigail (Roger is Abigail's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Abigail) → George (George is Abigail's descendant: Judith ancestor of George) → Harold (George is Harold's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Harold) → Kayla (Harold is Kayla's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Kayla) → Philip (Kayla is Philip's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Philip) → Matthew (Matthew is Philip's descendant: Judith ancestor of Matthew) → Grace (Matthew is Grace's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Grace) → Janet (Grace is Janet's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Janet) → Nathan (Janet is Nathan's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Nathan) → Zachary (Zachary is Nathan's descendant: Judith ancestor of Zachary) → Megan (Megan is Zachary's descendant: Judith ancestor of Megan) → Douglas (Megan is Douglas's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Douglas) → Jose (Douglas is Jose's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Jose) → Austin (Austin is Jose's descendant: Judith ancestor of Austin) → Cheryl (Cheryl is Austin's descendant: Judith ancestor of Cheryl) → Elizabeth (Elizabeth is Cheryl's descendant: Judith ancestor of Elizabeth) → Kathleen (Kathleen is Elizabeth's descendant: Judith ancestor of Kathleen) → William (William is Kathleen's descendant: Judith ancestor of William) → John (John is William's descendant: Judith ancestor of John) → Beverly (John is Beverly's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Beverly) → Eric (Eric is Beverly's descendant: Judith ancestor of Eric) → Patrick (Eric is Patrick's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Patrick) → Joyce (Patrick is Joyce's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Joyce) → Hannah (Joyce is Hannah's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Hannah) → Gloria (Hannah is Gloria's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Gloria) → Christian (Gloria is Christian's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Christian) → Ruth (Ruth is Christian's descendant: Judith ancestor of Ruth) → Bryan (Bryan is Ruth's descendant: Judith ancestor of Bryan) → Gerald (Bryan is Gerald's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Gerald) → Sarah (Gerald is Sarah's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Sarah) → Russell (Sarah is Russell's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Russell) → Denise (Russell is Denise's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Denise) → Emily (Emily is Denise's descendant: Judith ancestor of Emily) → Lauren (Lauren is Emily's descendant: Judith ancestor of Lauren) → Henry (Henry is Lauren's descendant: Judith ancestor of Henry) → Michelle (Henry is Michelle's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Michelle) → Jesse (Michelle is Jesse's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Jesse) → Shirley (Shirley is Jesse's descendant: Judith ancestor of Shirley) → Patricia (Shirley is Patricia's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Patricia) → Jason (Jason is Patricia's descendant: Judith ancestor of Jason) → Robert (Robert is Jason's descendant: Judith ancestor of Robert) → Amy (Robert is Amy's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Amy) → Brittany (Brittany is Amy's descendant: Judith ancestor of Brittany) → Alice (Brittany is Alice's ancestor: Judith ancestor of Alice) → Jordan (Jordan is Alice's descendant: Judith ancestor of Jordan) → Edward (Edward is Jordan's descendant: Judith ancestor of Edward) → Deborah (Deborah is Edward's descendant: Edward ancestor of Deborah, so Judith ancestor of Deborah). \n\nWow, so that's a long chain, but every step checks out.
