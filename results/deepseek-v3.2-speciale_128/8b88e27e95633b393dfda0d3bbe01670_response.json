We need to determine the relationship between David and Thomas. Specifically, we need to select one of the given options: common descendant, common ancestor, David is Thomas's descendant, David is Thomas's ancestor, or none of the above.\n\nWe need to parse the statements and build a directed graph of ancestry/descendant relationships. Each statement gives a directed edge: if \"X is Y's ancestor\", then X -> Y (X is ancestor of Y). If \"X is Y's descendant\", then Y -> X (Y is ancestor of X). So we can treat each as a directed edge from ancestor to descendant.\n\nLet's list all statements and convert them uniformly to ancestor->descendant edges.

Also other statements that involve David? Not directly others. Thomas appears in \"Brandon is Thomas's descendant.\" which means Thomas -> Brandon. Also maybe other statements? Not directly. So we need to see if there is any chain linking David and Thomas through other people.\n\nWe need to see if David is an ancestor/descendant of Thomas, or if they share common ancestor or descendant, or none.\n\nWe can attempt to build a graph and see if there is a directed path from David to Thomas (meaning David is ancestor of Thomas) or from Thomas to David (Thomas is ancestor of David) or if they have a common node reachable from both (common ancestor) or a node that reaches both (common descendant). But careful: \"common ancestor\" means there exists some person X such that X is ancestor of both David and Thomas. \"common descendant\" means there exists some person Y such that both David and Thomas are ancestors of Y. Since we have directed edges ancestor->descendant, common ancestor means a node that can reach both David and Thomas (maybe via paths). Common descendant means a node that can be reached from both David and Thomas.\n\nWe need to determine which of these holds (if any) based on the given relations.\n\nWe have many statements; we can try to compute connectivity. Since the graph may be large, we need to systematically find paths between David and Thomas.\n\nLet's list all people mentioned (unique names) to get a sense.\n\nList names: I'll compile as we go.\n\nFrom each statement, note names:\n\n1.

Also perhaps other statements indirectly? Not directly. So we need to see if there's any chain linking these.\n\nWe can attempt to construct the graph and see connectivity.\n\nBetter approach: We have many statements; maybe we can trace paths from David forward to see if we eventually reach Thomas or a common node, and also from Thomas backward/forward.\n\nBut we must be careful because relationships are directional. Let's create a systematic way: treat each person as node. We'll try to find all ancestors and descendants of David and Thomas.\n\nFrom David: David -> Sophia (47). Also maybe other statements that have David as descendant? None. So David only has outgoing edge to Sophia. So David's descendants are Sophia and any descendants of Sophia.\n\nFrom Sophia: we have \"Jonathan is Sophia's descendant.\" (68: Sophia -> Jonathan). Also any other statements where Sophia appears as ancestor? Not directly. But Sophia could appear as descendant? Statement 47 says David is Sophia's ancestor, so Sophia is David's descendant. That's it. Also maybe other statements: \"Jonathan is Sophia's descendant\" gave us Sophia -> Jonathan. So we can follow.\n\nJonathan: appears in statements: \"Megan is Jonathan's descendant.\" (8: Jonathan -> Megan). Also \"Jonathan is Sophia's descendant.\" we used. So from Jonathan we have outgoing to Megan.\n\nMegan: appears in \"James is Megan's descendant.\" (125: Megan -> James). Also \"Megan is Jonathan's descendant.\" incoming.

Let's verify the path:\n\nDavid -> Sophia -> Jonathan -> Megan -> James -> Ruth -> Amanda -> Robert -> John -> Sara -> Patrick -> Barbara -> Helen -> Frances -> Alice -> Dorothy -> Mary -> Pamela -> Kenneth -> Cheryl -> Amber -> Joshua -> Isabella -> Joseph -> Gloria -> Sandra -> Charlotte -> Gary -> Randy -> Russell -> Joyce -> Vincent -> Eugene -> Frank -> Natalie -> Janice -> Donna -> Ralph -> Jerry -> Ann -> Kayla -> Zachary -> William -> Carl -> Martha -> Evelyn -> George -> Jesse -> Kelly -> Kyle -> Rebecca -> Mason -> Christopher -> Virginia -> Heather -> Adam -> Theresa -> Tyler -> Patricia -> Jeffrey -> Janet -> Laura -> Carolyn -> Alexander -> Victoria -> Beverly -> Steven -> Nicholas -> Shirley -> Angela -> Roger -> Peter -> Gerald -> Timothy -> Sarah -> Albert -> Christina -> Elijah -> Stephanie -> Austin -> Bryan -> Amy? Wait, we went from Austin to Bryan to Amy, but then we continued? Actually after Austin we had Austin -> Bryan, Bryan -> Amy. But from Amy we didn't have a continuation; we then went to Willie? But our chain above from Bryan to Amy, then we need to connect to Thomas. However, recall we had an alternative path: from Amy we didn't have a direct out. But earlier, after Amy, we branched to Willie? But that goes from Samantha -> Willie -> Amy, so Amy is descendant of Willie, not ancestor. So after Bryan -> Amy, we need to see if Amy connects to something else that leads to Thomas. Actually we haven't connected Amy to the rest of the chain that leads to Thomas. But we followed from David all the way to Bryan. Then from Bryan we could go to Amy, but that seems to be a leaf? Let's check: from Amy, there is no outgoing edge (i.e., no statement where Amy is ancestor of someone else, except maybe? \"Bryan is Amy's ancestor\" gives Bryan->Amy. \"Willie is Amy's ancestor\" gives Willie->Amy. So Amy is a descendant, not an ancestor of others. So if we go from David to Bryan, that's a path that ends at Bryan? Actually Bryan -> Amy, but then we can't go further. So that doesn't lead to Thomas.\n\nBut earlier, we had a long chain that went from David to many people and eventually to Thomas. Let's retrace: After Austin, we went to Bryan, but then we continued after Bryan? I think I got lost. Let's re-evaluate the path we constructed systematically. We started from David and walked forward using each person's outgoing edges (i.e., the person as ancestor). At each step, we used one outgoing edge. We continued until we reached Thomas? But Thomas is an ancestor of Brandon, so to reach Thomas we need to go backwards? Actually we are trying to see if David is an ancestor of Thomas or descendant. Our path is from David forward through many generations. If we eventually reach Thomas, that would mean David is ancestor of Thomas. But Thomas appears as ancestor in Thomas->Brandon. In our forward chain, we eventually reached Brandon (through many steps), and then from Brandon we went to Alan, etc., and then eventually we got back to? Wait, I need to check direction: All edges are ancestor->descendant. So if we start at David and follow edges forward (ancestor to descendant), we will go to descendants. If we reach Thomas, that means David is an ancestor of Thomas (since we follow from David to ... to Thomas). But is Thomas a descendant of David? That would mean there is a directed path from David to Thomas. In our chain we indeed seemed to go from David to Thomas? But we ended at Brandon, then Alan, then Kevin, then Ronald, then Hannah, then Maria, then Betty, then Judith, then Michael, then Dylan, then Charles, then Gregory, then Lori, then Danielle, then Ashley, then Benjamin, then Douglas, then Carol, then Rachel, then Elizabeth, then Grace, then Katherine, then Catherine, then Lauren, then Christine, then Raymond, then Walter, then Diane, then Cynthia, then Emily, then Donald, then Stephen, then Jose, then Henry, then Samuel, then Richard, then Logan, then Diana, then Joe, then Nathan, then Doris, then Nicole, then Joan, then Samantha, then Willie, then Amy? That seems like we went through many nodes, but we need to check if we eventually reached Thomas. Actually we got to Brandon from Thomas? Wait, we started from David and eventually arrived at Thomas? Let's re-evaluate from the beginning, but perhaps more systematically.\n\nWe have a huge chain that seems to connect all nodes into a giant cycle? But note that ancestry relationships are acyclic (should be, but could be contradictions? but we assume they are consistent). However, if we follow the chain we might end up cycling. But the statements may form a long line connecting many people. Indeed, we traced from David forward (ancestor->descendant) using the following edges:\n\nDavid -> Sophia (47)\nSophia -> Jonathan (68)\nJonathan -> Megan (8)\nMegan -> James (125)\nJames -> Ruth (90)\nRuth -> Amanda (13)\nAmanda -> Robert (108)\nRobert -> John (91)\nJohn -> Sara (87)\nSara -> Patrick (102)\nPatrick -> Barbara (92)\nBarbara -> Helen (34)\nHelen -> Frances (126)\nFrances -> Alice (113)\nAlice -> Dorothy (12)\nDorothy -> Mary (93)\nMary -> Pamela (86)\nPamela -> Kenneth (19)\nKenneth -> Cheryl (26)   [Note: careful: Cheryl is Kenneth's descendant => Kenneth -> Cheryl]\nCheryl -> Amber (17)\nAmber -> Joshua (23)\nJoshua -> Isabella (59)\nIsabella -> Joseph (38)\nJoseph -> Gloria (15)\nGloria -> Sandra (7)\nSandra -> Charlotte (31)\nCharlotte -> Gary (37)\nGary -> Randy (18)\nRandy -> Russell (35)\nRussell -> Joyce (69)\nJoyce -> Vincent (111)\nVincent -> Eugene (114)\nEugene -> Frank (115)\nFrank -> Natalie (53)\nNatalie -> Janice (6)\nJanice -> Donna (20)\nDonna -> Ralph (42)\nRalph -> Jerry (74)\nJerry -> Ann (82)\nAnn -> Kayla (62)\nKayla -> Zachary (88)\nZachary -> William (58)\nWilliam -> Carl (117)\nCarl -> Martha (110)\nMartha -> Evelyn (28)\nEvelyn -> George (24)\nGeorge -> Jesse (10)\nJesse -> Kelly (4)\nKelly -> Kyle (89)\nKyle -> Rebecca (66)\nRebecca -> Mason (56)\nMason -> Christopher (72)\nChristopher -> Virginia (70)\nVirginia -> Heather (29)\nHeather -> Adam (64)\nAdam -> Theresa (123)\nTheresa -> Tyler (98)\nTyler -> Patricia (95)\nPatricia -> Jeffrey (67)\nJeffrey -> Janet (65)\nJanet -> Laura (112)\nLaura -> Carolyn (124)\nCarolyn -> Alexander (14)\nAlexander -> Victoria (30)\nVictoria -> Beverly (49)\nBeverly -> Steven (43)\nSteven -> Nicholas (105)\nNicholas -> Shirley (55)\nShirley -> Angela (54)\nAngela -> Roger (22)\nRoger -> Peter (50)\nPeter -> Gerald (76)\nGerald -> Timothy (48)\nTimothy -> Sarah (51)\nSarah -> Albert (94)\nAlbert -> Christina (120)\nChristina -> Elijah (100)\nElijah -> Stephanie (25)\nStephanie -> Austin (81)\nAustin -> Bryan (99)\nBryan -> Amy (127)\n\nNow, after Bryan->Amy, we are at Amy. Does Amy have an outgoing edge? Not directly. However, we have \"Willie is Amy's ancestor\" (46) which is Willie -> Amy, not Amy -> something. So Amy has no outgoing edges that we can follow forward. So our forward chain seems to stop at Amy.\n\nBut we haven't reached Thomas. So from David to Amy, we have a long chain, but not Thomas.\n\nNow, we also have many other edges that we haven't used. Perhaps we can go from Amy to something else? But no outgoing from Amy. So from David we cannot reach Thomas by following ancestor->descendant edges forward, at least not via the path we took. But maybe there is another branch we could take at some point that leads to Thomas. For example, at some node, there might be multiple outgoing edges. We need to explore all possible paths from David to see if any leads to Thomas. Similarly, we could explore paths from Thomas to see if we can reach David, meaning Thomas is ancestor of David.\n\nAlternatively, we might need to find a common ancestor or descendant.\n\nWe need to consider the entire graph. It seems that the given statements might form a single connected component, because we have linked many nodes. We can try to see if David and Thomas are in the same connected component via undirected connectivity, but we need direction to determine ancestor/descendant relationship.\n\nGiven the huge number of statements, it's plausible that David and Thomas are connected via some path. The path we followed from David went to many nodes, but we didn't include all edges. For instance, there are edges like \"Samantha is Willie's ancestor\" (77) which we haven't used because we didn't go to Samantha from anywhere in that chain. But we might be able to go from Amy to Willie? No, that's backward. But we could go from someone else to Samantha and then to Willie, etc. Maybe from some node earlier, we can branch to a different path that leads to Thomas. For example, we have \"Michael is Judith's descendant\" (36) which we used in reverse? Actually we used Judith -> Michael? In our forward chain from David, we didn't go through Judith. We went from David to Sophia, etc. That path didn't include Judith. But there might be an alternative path from some node like Jonathan, etc. But we need to systematically explore the graph.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the chain we traced actually goes around and eventually loops back to Thomas. Wait, maybe after Amy we could continue via other relations that connect Amy to someone else? Let's see if Amy appears as an ancestor in any statement. The only statements with Amy: \"Willie is Amy's ancestor\" (46) and \"Bryan is Amy's ancestor\" (127). So Amy is only a descendant. So no forward edges from Amy.\n\nBut what about the other branch: from David to Sophia to Jonathan to ... we went along a specific choice at each node. But maybe some nodes have multiple outgoing edges. Let's check each node we passed for any additional outgoing edges that we didn't take, which could lead to a path to Thomas.\n\nWe'll compile all outgoing edges from each node in the graph based on statements.\n\nWe have 127 statements, each gives one directed edge (ancestor -> descendant). Some nodes might have multiple outgoing edges (if they appear as ancestor in multiple statements). Also some nodes might have multiple incoming edges (if multiple ancestors? But typically each person has two biological parents, but here it's not necessarily limited, but statements are given; they may indicate specific relationships. So we need to consider all edges.\n\nWe'll list all edges (ancestor -> descendant) extracted from statements. We'll number them for reference.\n\nFrom each statement, convert to edge A->D:\n\n1. Maria -> Betty\n2. Raymond -> Walter\n3. Samuel -> Richard\n4. Jesse -> Kelly\n5. Betty -> Judith (since Judith is Betty's descendant => Betty ancestor of Judith)\n6. Natalie -> Janice\n7.

Megan -> James (James is Megan's descendant => Megan->James)\n126. Helen -> Frances\n127. Bryan -> Amy\n\nWe have 127 directed edges.\n\nNow, we need to find relationship between David and Thomas.\n\nWe can approach by building the graph and then exploring reachability: from David forward (descendants) and backward (ancestors). Similarly for Thomas.\n\nWe can try to compute the set of all ancestors of David (people who are ancestors of David) and all descendants of David. Then compare with Thomas.\n\nBut given the large graph, we might try to see if there's a path from David to Thomas or Thomas to David using the chain we already have.\n\nNotice: In our long forward chain from David, we went through many nodes, but we ended at Amy. However, there are many other edges we didn't follow. For example, at many nodes, there could be alternative outgoing edges that we didn't take. Let's examine nodes we passed and see if any of them have additional outgoing edges that could lead to Thomas.\n\nWe'll list all nodes from David forward path and see other outgoing edges from those nodes (based on the edge list). If any such edge leads (via some path) to Thomas, then David might be ancestor of Thomas. Similarly, we can check backward from Thomas.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to find a path connecting David and Thomas by exploring the entire graph. Given that the statements seem to form a huge chain that includes many people, it's likely that David and Thomas are in the same connected component. In fact, the chain we traced from David ended at Amy, but we also have a chain from Thomas backward? Let's see Thomas->Brandon->Alan->Kevin->Ronald->Hannah->Maria->Betty->Judith->Michael->Dylan->Charles->Gregory->Lori->Danielle->Ashley->Benjamin->Douglas->Carol->Rachel->Elizabeth->Grace->Katherine->Catherine->Lauren->Christine->Raymond->Walter->Diane->Cynthia->Emily->Donald->Stephen->Jose->Henry->Samuel->Richard->Logan->Diana->Joe->Nathan->Doris->Nicole->Joan->Samantha->Willie->Amy. That seems to be a similar chain but in the opposite direction? Actually let's see: Starting from Thomas, we can go forward (descendants) using outgoing edges. Thomas -> Brandon (118). Then Brandon -> Alan (97). Alan -> Kevin (121). Kevin -> Ronald (61). Ronald -> Hannah (80). Hannah -> Maria (27). Maria -> Betty (1). Betty -> Judith (5). Judith -> Michael (36). Michael -> Dylan (96). Dylan -> Charles (106). Charles -> Gregory (75). Gregory -> Lori (40). Lori -> Danielle (9). Danielle -> Ashley (78). Ashley -> Benjamin (16). Benjamin -> Douglas (103). Douglas -> Carol (57). Carol -> Rachel (11). Rachel -> Elizabeth (116). Elizabeth -> Grace (109). Grace -> Katherine (107). Katherine -> Catherine (52). Catherine -> Lauren (122). Lauren -> Christine (119). Christine -> Raymond (104). Raymond -> Walter (2). Walter -> Diane (101). Diane -> Cynthia (44). Cynthia -> Emily (84). Emily -> Donald (71). Donald -> Stephen (41). Stephen -> Jose (21). Jose -> Henry (60). Henry -> Samuel (33). Samuel -> Richard (3). Richard -> Logan (85). Logan -> Diana (45). Diana -> Joe (73). Joe -> Nathan (32). Nathan -> Doris (79). Doris -> Nicole (39). Nicole -> Joan (83). Joan -> Samantha (63). Samantha -> Willie (77). Willie -> Amy (46). So from Thomas forward we also reach Amy. So both David's forward chain and Thomas's forward chain end at Amy? Actually from David we ended at Amy (via Bryan). From Thomas we also end at Amy (via Willie). That suggests that Amy is a common descendant of both David and Thomas? Let's check: David's forward chain: David -> ... -> Bryan -> Amy. So David is ancestor of Amy. Thomas's forward chain: Thomas -> ... -> Willie -> Amy. So Thomas is also ancestor of Amy. Therefore, Amy is a common descendant of David and Thomas. That would correspond to option 1: David and Thomas share a common descendant.\n\nBut we need to verify that the paths are valid and there are no contradictions or multiple possible paths. Also we need to confirm that there is no direct ancestor/descendant relationship between David and Thomas (i.e., one is ancestor of the other) that would supersede? The options are mutually exclusive? Possibly if they share a common descendant, that is true even if they also have a common ancestor, but the question likely expects the most direct or the one that can be deduced from the given. The options are:\n\n1. David and Thomas share a common descendant.\n2. David and Thomas share a common ancestor.\n3. David is Thomas's descendant.\n4. David is Thomas's ancestor.\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nWe have found that Amy is a common descendant. But we should check if there is any possibility that David is an ancestor of Thomas or Thomas is ancestor of David. If that were true, then they would also share a common descendant (since if David is ancestor of Thomas, then any descendant of Thomas is also descendant of David, so they share common descendants as well). But the question likely asks for the lineage relationship that can be determined. Possibly more than one could be true, but we need to select the correct one based on the given statements. Usually these questions expect the specific relationship that directly follows from the statements. However, sometimes multiple could be true, but we need to see if one is definitely true based on the information. If both (say) David is ancestor of Thomas and they share a common descendant, then both 1 and 4 would be true, but the answer choices are single-select. So we need to determine which relationship is definitively supported by the statements. It could be that we can prove they share a common descendant, but we cannot prove that one is ancestor of the other (since there might be no direct path). So likely the answer is 1.\n\nBut we must also check if there is any path from David to Thomas or vice versa. Let's explore if there is any directed path from David to Thomas or from Thomas to David.\n\nFrom David forward we reached many nodes; we could check if Thomas appears in the forward reachable set from David. From Thomas forward we reached many nodes; we could check if David appears in the forward reachable set from Thomas. If neither reachable, then they are not in a direct ancestor/descendant relationship. But they could still share common ancestor or descendant.\n\nWe already have common descendant Amy. But we should also check if they share a common ancestor. Possibly they might also share a common ancestor, but that's not contradictory; however, the question likely asks for the lineage relationship that can be determined from the given statements. It might be that both 1 and 2 are true? We need to see if we can find a common ancestor. For that, we would need to find someone who is ancestor of both David and Thomas. That would require going backward from both. Let's see: David's ancestors? We only have David's incoming edges? Does David appear as descendant of anyone? Statement 47 says David is Sophia's ancestor, so Sophia is descendant of David, not ancestor. So David has no given ancestors. However, we could infer ancestors if there is a path to David from someone via incoming edges. Since edges are ancestor->descendant, to find ancestors of David, we look for nodes that have a path ending at David. That means we need to find a node X such that there is a directed path X -> ... -> David. Does any edge point to David? No statement has David as descendant. So David has no known ancestors (in the graph). Similarly, Thomas appears as ancestor in Thomas->Brandon, but does Thomas appear as descendant of anyone? Not directly. However, we might be able to find an ancestor of Thomas if there is a path to Thomas. That would require an incoming edge to Thomas: does any statement say \"X is Thomas's ancestor\" or \"Thomas is X's descendant\"? No. So Thomas also has no known ancestors. So they cannot share a common ancestor (unless there is a path from some node to both David and Thomas, but since neither has incoming edges, the only possible common ancestor would be themselves, but that doesn't count). So they do not share a common ancestor (unless we consider that everyone might be connected through cycles? But ancestry is typically acyclic; a person cannot be their own ancestor. Since David and Thomas have no incoming edges, they are source nodes. They could still have a common ancestor if there is some node that reaches both via paths, but that would require that node has outgoing paths to both. For that, both David and Thomas must have some ancestor. Since we see no edges into David or Thomas, they are likely source nodes, so no common ancestor. However, could there be a path from some node to David indirectly? For that, we would need a chain like X -> ... -> David. But we have no statement with David as descendant, so no. So David has no ancestors in this graph. Similarly, Thomas has no ancestors. Thus they cannot share a common ancestor (other than maybe if David = Thomas, but they are distinct). So option 2 is false.\n\nOption 3: David is Thomas's descendant. That would require a directed path from Thomas to David. Does such a path exist? We would need Thomas -> ... -> David. Thomas has outgoing edge to Brandon. So we can go forward from Thomas. We need to see if we can reach David from Thomas. From Thomas forward we went to Brandon, Alan, Kevin, Ronald, Hannah, Maria, Betty, Judith, Michael, Dylan, Charles, Gregory, Lori, Danielle, Ashley, Benjamin, Douglas, Carol, Rachel, Elizabeth, Grace, Katherine, Catherine, Lauren, Christine, Raymond, Walter, Diane, Cynthia, Emily, Donald, Stephen, Jose, Henry, Samuel, Richard, Logan, Diana, Joe, Nathan, Doris, Nicole, Joan, Samantha, Willie, Amy. That path doesn't include David. Are there other branches from these nodes that could lead to David? Possibly. We need to examine all nodes reachable from Thomas. Similarly, from David forward we need to see if we can reach Thomas. If neither reachable, then 3 and 4 are false.\n\nThus the most evident is common descendant: Amy appears in both forward closures. So option 1 is true.\n\nBut we must ensure that Amy is indeed reachable from David via a directed path. In our earlier forward chain from David, we went through many nodes and ended at Amy via Bryan. However, we need to verify that this path is valid and no contradictions (like we used edges that might conflict with direction). We walked through a long chain. Let's verify the exact path from David to Amy step by step using the edge list.\n\nWe'll construct a forward path from David to Amy:\n\nStart: David\n\n47: David -> Sophia\n\n68: Sophia -> Jonathan\n\n8: Jonathan -> Megan\n\n125: Megan -> James (since James is Megan's descendant: Megan -> James)\n\n90: James -> Ruth\n\n13: Ruth -> Amanda\n\n108: Amanda -> Robert\n\n91: Robert -> John\n\n87: John -> Sara\n\n102: Sara -> Patrick\n\n92: Patrick -> Barbara\n\n34: Barbara -> Helen\n\n126: Helen -> Frances\n\n113: Frances -> Alice\n\n12: Alice -> Dorothy\n\n93: Dorothy -> Mary\n\n86: Mary -> Pamela\n\n19: Pamela -> Kenneth\n\n26: Kenneth -> Cheryl (Kenneth -> Cheryl)\n\n17: Cheryl -> Amber\n\n23: Amber -> Joshua\n\n59: Joshua -> Isabella\n\n38: Isabella -> Joseph\n\n15: Joseph -> Gloria\n\n7: Gloria -> Sandra\n\n31: Sandra -> Charlotte\n\n37: Charlotte -> Gary\n\n18: Gary -> Randy\n\n35: Randy -> Russell\n\n69: Russell -> Joyce\n\n111: Joyce -> Vincent\n\n114: Vincent -> Eugene\n\n115: Eugene -> Frank\n\n53: Frank -> Natalie\n\n6: Natalie -> Janice\n\n20: Janice -> Donna\n\n42: Donna -> Ralph\n\n74: Ralph -> Jerry\n\n82: Jerry -> Ann\n\n62: Ann -> Kayla\n\n88: Kayla -> Zachary\n\n58: Zachary -> William\n\n117: William -> Carl\n\n110: Carl -> Martha\n\n28: Martha -> Evelyn\n\n24: Evelyn -> George\n\n10: George -> Jesse\n\n4: Jesse -> Kelly\n\n89: Kelly -> Kyle\n\n66: Kyle -> Rebecca\n\n56: Rebecca -> Mason\n\n72: Mason -> Christopher\n\n70: Christopher -> Virginia\n\n29: Virginia -> Heather\n\n64: Heather -> Adam\n\n123: Adam -> Theresa\n\n98: Theresa -> Tyler\n\n95: Tyler -> Patricia\n\n67: Patricia -> Jeffrey\n\n65: Jeffrey -> Janet\n\n112: Janet -> Laura\n\n124: Laura -> Carolyn\n\n14: Carolyn -> Alexander\n\n30: Alexander -> Victoria\n\n49: Victoria -> Beverly\n\n43: Beverly -> Steven\n\n105: Steven -> Nicholas\n\n55: Nicholas -> Shirley\n\n54: Shirley -> Angela\n\n22: Angela -> Roger\n\n50: Roger -> Peter\n\n76: Peter -> Gerald\n\n48: Gerald -> Timothy\n\n51: Timothy -> Sarah\n\n94: Sarah -> Albert\n\n120: Albert -> Christina\n\n100: Christina -> Elijah\n\n25: Elijah -> Stephanie\n\n81: Stephanie -> Austin\n\n99: Austin -> Bryan\n\n127: Bryan -> Amy\n\nYes, that is a valid path, using edges as listed. It is consistent. So Amy is a descendant of David.\n\nNow, from Thomas to Amy:\n\n118: Thomas -> Brandon\n\n97: Brandon -> Alan\n\n121: Alan -> Kevin\n\n61: Kevin -> Ronald\n\n80: Ronald -> Hannah\n\n27: Hannah -> Maria\n\n1: Maria -> Betty\n\n5: Betty -> Judith\n\n36: Judith -> Michael\n\n96: Michael -> Dylan\n\n106: Dylan -> Charles\n\n75: Charles -> Gregory\n\n40: Gregory -> Lori\n\n9: Lori -> Danielle\n\n78: Danielle -> Ashley\n\n16: Ashley -> Benjamin\n\n103: Benjamin -> Douglas\n\n57: Douglas -> Carol\n\n11: Carol -> Rachel\n\n116: Rachel -> Elizabeth\n\n109: Elizabeth -> Grace\n\n107: Grace -> Katherine\n\n52: Katherine -> Catherine\n\n122: Catherine -> Lauren\n\n119: Lauren -> Christine\n\n104: Christine -> Raymond\n\n2: Raymond -> Walter\n\n101: Walter -> Diane\n\n44: Diane -> Cynthia\n\n84: Cynthia -> Emily\n\n71: Emily -> Donald\n\n41: Donald -> Stephen\n\n21: Stephen -> Jose\n\n60: Jose -> Henry\n\n33: Henry -> Samuel\n\n3: Samuel -> Richard\n\n85: Richard -> Logan\n\n45: Logan -> Diana\n\n73: Diana -> Joe\n\n32: Joe -> Nathan\n\n79: Nathan -> Doris\n\n39: Doris -> Nicole\n\n83: Nicole -> Joan\n\n63: Joan -> Samantha\n\n77: Samantha -> Willie\n\n46: Willie -> Amy\n\nYes, valid. So Amy is also a descendant of Thomas.\n\nThus David and Thomas share a common descendant: Amy.\n\nNow, could there be a direct ancestor/descendant relationship? Let's explore if Thomas is reachable from David. From David's forward path, we eventually go to many nodes. Could any of them lead to Thomas? We would need to find a node that has an outgoing edge to Thomas. But Thomas has no incoming edges? Wait, Thomas has an incoming edge? Actually Thomas appears as ancestor in edge 118: Thomas -> Brandon. That means Thomas is the ancestor, not descendant. For Thomas to be a descendant of David, we need a path David -> ... -> Thomas. That would require some node that has an outgoing edge to Thomas. Is there any statement where someone is Thomas's ancestor? That would be \"X is Thomas's ancestor\" or \"Thomas is X's descendant\". We have no such statement. So Thomas has no known ancestors. Therefore, there is no edge pointing to Thomas. Thus Thomas cannot be reached from any node (including David) as a descendant, because there is no incoming edge to Thomas. Therefore, David cannot be an ancestor of Thomas (since that would require a path to Thomas). Wait, ancestor means David is ancestor of Thomas, i.e., David -> ... -> Thomas. That would require Thomas to have an incoming edge from some node, and a path from David to that node eventually leading to Thomas. But we just said Thomas has no incoming edges? Let's double-check all edges: we listed edges A->D. Look for any edge where the descendant is Thomas. Our list: none have Thomas as the second element. The only occurrence of Thomas is in edge 118 as the ancestor, not descendant. So Thomas has no incoming edges. Therefore, Thomas has no ancestors in this graph. So it's impossible for David (or anyone else) to be an ancestor of Thomas, because that would imply an edge leading to Thomas somewhere. Unless there is a path that includes Thomas as an intermediate node? But to be a descendant, Thomas must be reachable as a target of some edge. Since none exist, Thomas is a source node (no ancestors). Therefore, David cannot be ancestor of Thomas. So option 4 is false.\n\nSimilarly, can Thomas be ancestor of David? That would require a path Thomas -> ... -> David. David has an incoming edge? Yes, David appears as ancestor in edge 47: David -> Sophia. That makes David an ancestor, not descendant. Is there any edge where David is the descendant? No. So David has no incoming edges either. Therefore, David is also a source node. So Thomas cannot be ancestor of David because that would require an edge to David. So option 3 is false.\n\nThus the only plausible is option 1: they share a common descendant (Amy). Option 2 (common ancestor) would require a node that is ancestor of both. Since both are sources (no ancestors), they have no ancestors, so they cannot share a common ancestor (unless we consider that they themselves are common ancestors of each other? No). So option 2 false.\n\nOption 5 none would be false since 1 is true.\n\nThus answer should be 1.\n\nBut we must be absolutely sure that there is no other interpretation: Could there be a statement that indirectly gives an ancestor for David or Thomas? For example, if there is a statement like \"X is Y's descendant\", that gives Y as ancestor. So if there is a statement \"David is Z's descendant\", then Z would be ancestor of David. We have no such statement. Similarly for Thomas. So indeed they are sources.\n\nNow, is it possible that through transitivity, even without a direct edge into Thomas, we could have a path David -> ... -> Thomas if some node points to Thomas? But there is no edge with Thomas as descendant, so no path can end at Thomas. So Thomas is not a descendant of anyone. Therefore David cannot be ancestor of Thomas. Similarly, Thomas cannot be ancestor of David.\n\nThus answer is 1.\n\nBut we should double-check: Could there be a statement that gives Thomas as descendant but we misinterpreted? Let's scan the original statements again for any mention of Thomas:\n\nThe statements list:\n\n* ... (many)\n* Brandon is Thomas's descendant. (118) That's the only one with Thomas. Yes.\n\nSo Thomas appears only in that statement as ancestor. So no ancestor for Thomas.\n\nDavid appears only in \"David is Sophia's ancestor.\" So David is ancestor only. So no descendant for David.\n\nThus indeed both are source nodes.\n\nTherefore, they share a common descendant (Amy) as we found.\n\nBut we must also confirm that Amy is indeed a person, and that the path is valid. We did.\n\nThus answer is option 1.\n\nBut wait: there might be multiple common descendants. But we just need to know they share a common descendant. So answer 1 is correct.\n\nLet's also check if there is any possibility that they share a common ancestor indirectly through some node that is ancestor of both? Since both have no incoming edges, the only way they could have a common ancestor is if that common ancestor is themselves, which is nonsense. Unless there is a node that is an ancestor of David but not directly given? For David to have an ancestor, we need some statement where David is descendant. There is none. So David's set of ancestors is empty. Similarly for Thomas. Intersection empty. So no common ancestor.\n\nThus answer is 1.\n\nNow, is there any chance that the path from David to Amy or Thomas to Amy might be invalid due to contradictory statements? We must ensure that we didn't use an edge in the wrong direction. We double-checked each step.\n\nBut also note: In the forward chain from David, we used edge 125: Megan -> James. Statement 125 is \"James is Megan's descendant.\" So yes, Megan -> James. Good.\n\nWe also used edge 90: James -> Ruth. Statement 90: \"James is Ruth's ancestor.\" So James -> Ruth.\n\nEdge 13: Ruth -> Amanda. Statement 13: \"Amanda is Ruth's descendant.\" So Ruth -> Amanda.\n\nEdge 108: Amanda -> Robert.

So they share a common descendant: Amy.\n\nTherefore answer is 1.\n\nBefore finalizing, let's consider if there could be any other common descendant? Possibly, but that doesn't matter.\n\nOne might also check if there is any common ancestor: none.\n\nThus answer is <ANSWER>1</ANSWER>.\n\nBut we must also check if there is any statement that could imply David is a descendant of someone else indirectly. For example, if there is a statement \"X is David's ancestor\", we would have an edge X->David. There is no such statement. So David's ancestors set is empty. Similarly Thomas's ancestors set is empty.\n\nThus final answer: 1."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":987,"completion_tokens":18425,"total_tokens":19412,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":18417},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":987},"system_fingerprint":"fp_9ebb288cdf_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
