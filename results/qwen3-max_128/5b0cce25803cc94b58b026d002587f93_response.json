Not directly.\n\nBut maybe there are other links connecting these individuals.\n\nLet’s look for any statements that might connect either chain to a common person.\n\nCheck if **Olivia** appears elsewhere:\n\n- **Olivia is Victoria's ancestor.** (already used)\n- **Olivia is Zachary's descendant.**\n- **Edward is Zachary's ancestor.**\n- **Edward is Patricia's descendant.**\n- **John is Patricia's ancestor.**\n- **Pamela is John's ancestor.**\n- **Emily is Pamela's ancestor.**\n- **Emily is Bruce's descendant.**\n- **Justin is Bruce's ancestor.**\n- **Lawrence is Justin's ancestor.**\n- **Lawrence is Diana's descendant.**\n- **Sharon is Diana's ancestor.**\n- **Sharon is Ann's descendant.**\n- **Ann is Kimberly's descendant.**\n- **Denise is Kimberly's ancestor.**\n- **Denise is Joyce's descendant.**\n- **Joyce is Harold's descendant.**\n- **Alice is Harold's ancestor.**\n- **Teresa is Alice's ancestor.**\n- **Teresa is Thomas's descendant.**\n- **Jean is Thomas's ancestor.**\n- **Jean is Gabriel's descendant.**\n- **Billy is Gabriel's ancestor.**\n- **Laura is Billy's ancestor.**\n- **Gary is Laura's ancestor.**\n- **Gary is Gerald's descendant.**\n- **Gerald is Janet's descendant.**\n- **Janet is Melissa's descendant.**\n- **Melissa is Evelyn's descendant.**\n- **Evelyn is Henry's descendant.**\n- **Rebecca is Henry's ancestor.**\n- **Rebecca is Arthur's descendant.**\n- **Russell is Arthur's ancestor.**\n- **Russell is Donald's descendant.**\n- **Juan is Donald's ancestor.**\n- **Brandon is Juan's ancestor.**\n- **Brandon is Adam's descendant.**\n- **Douglas is Adam's ancestor.**\n- **Anthony is Douglas's ancestor.**\n- **Anthony is Frank's descendant.**\n- **Frank is Stephanie's descendant.**\n- **Stephanie is Mary's descendant.**\n- **Mary is Jordan's descendant.**\n- **Benjamin is Jordan's ancestor.**\n- **William is Benjamin's descendant.**\n- **William is Katherine's ancestor.**\n- **Katherine is Isabella's ancestor.**\n- **Albert is Isabella's descendant.**\n- **Albert is Sarah's ancestor.**\n- **Sarah is Amanda's ancestor.**\n- **Amanda is Wayne's ancestor.**\n- **Catherine is Wayne's descendant.**\n- **Debra is Catherine's descendant.**\n- **Debra is Paul's ancestor.**\n- **Emma is Paul's descendant.**\n- **Emma is Frances's ancestor.**\n- **Samantha is Frances's descendant.**\n- **Samantha is Jerry's ancestor.**\n- **Helen is Jerry's descendant.**\n- **Helen is Timothy's ancestor.**\n- **Timothy is Eric's ancestor.**\n- **Joe is Eric's descendant.**\n- **Joe is Virginia's ancestor.**\n- **Jesse is Virginia's descendant.**\n- **Marilyn is Jesse's descendant.**\n- **Marilyn is Samuel's ancestor.**\n- **Stephen is Samuel's descendant.**\n- **Rachel is Sandra's descendant.**\n- **Sandra is Stephen's descendant.**\n- **Rachel is Ethan's ancestor.**\n- **Ethan is Sophia's ancestor.**\n- **Margaret is Sophia's descendant.**\n- **Margaret is Christine's ancestor.**\n- **Jason is Christine's descendant.**\n- **Jason is Theresa's ancestor.**\n- **Theresa is Jennifer's ancestor.**\n- **Bobby is Jennifer's descendant.**\n- **Ronald is Bobby's descendant.**\n- **Ralph is Ronald's descendant.**\n- **Logan is Ralph's descendant.**\n- **Logan is Robert's ancestor.**\n- **Raymond is Robert's descendant.**\n- **Mason is Raymond's descendant.**\n- **Mason is Karen's ancestor.**\n- **Dylan is Karen's descendant.**\n- **Dylan is Angela's ancestor.**\n- **Angela is Maria's ancestor.**\n- **Maria is Anna's ancestor.**\n- **Anna is Jacqueline's ancestor.**\n- **Jacqueline is Dennis's ancestor.**\n- **Nathan is Dennis's descendant.**\n- **Martha is Nathan's descendant.**\n- **Kevin is Martha's descendant.**\n- **Joseph is Kevin's descendant.**\n- **Joseph is Matthew's ancestor.**\n- **Ruth is Matthew's descendant.**\n- **Noah is Ruth's descendant.**\n- **Brian is Noah's descendant.**\n- **Brian is Richard's ancestor.**\n- **Cheryl is Richard's descendant.**\n- **Cheryl is Keith's ancestor.**\n- **Ashley is Keith's descendant.**\n- **Ashley is Alexander's ancestor.**\n- **Amber is Alexander's descendant.**\n- **Amber is Megan's ancestor.**\n- **Joshua is Megan's descendant.**\n- **Danielle is Joshua's descendant.**\n- **Danielle is Aaron's ancestor.**\n- **Aaron is Abigail's ancestor.**\n- **David is Abigail's descendant.**\n- **David is Donna's ancestor.**\n- **Jacob is Donna's descendant.**\n- **Tyler is Jacob's descendant.**\n- **Jeremy is Tyler's descendant.**\n- **Jeremy is Scott's ancestor.**\n- **Scott is Julie's ancestor.**\n- **Julie is Bradley's ancestor.**\n- **Barbara is Bradley's descendant.**\n\nWait! **Barbara is Bradley's descendant**, and **Julie is Bradley's ancestor**, so:\n\n- **Julie → Bradley → Barbara**\n\nBut earlier we had: **Barbara → Daniel → Kyle → Kathleen → Gloria → Grace**\n\nSo **Julie is an ancestor of Barbara**, and **Barbara is an ancestor of Grace**, so **Julie is an ancestor of Grace**.\n\nNow, from Janice’s side:\n\n- **Janice ← Nicholas ← Shirley ← Madison ← Victoria ← Olivia**\n\nAny link from this chain to **Julie** or others?\n\nLook at **Shirley**:\n\n- **Nicholas is Shirley's descendant.**\n- **Madison is Shirley's ancestor.**\n\nAny other mention of **Shirley**? No.\n\nWhat about **Nicholas**? Only appears in: **Janice is Nicholas's descendant.**\n\nSo Janice’s lineage seems isolated from the rest.\n\nNow check if **Grace** appears elsewhere: only in **Gloria is Grace's ancestor.**\n\nNow, is there any possibility that **Janice and Grace share a common ancestor**?\n\nThat would require some person A such that A is an ancestor of both Janice and Grace.\n\nFrom above:\n\n- Ancestors of Janice: Nicholas, Shirley, Madison, Victoria, Olivia\n\n- Ancestors of Grace: Gloria, Kathleen, Kyle, Daniel, Barbara, and then possibly more via Barbara.\n\nDoes **Olivia** appear in Grace’s ancestor chain? No.\n\nDoes **Barbara** appear in Janice’s chain? No.\n\nIs there any cross-link between the two trees?\n\nLet’s check if any of Janice’s ancestors appear as descendants of Grace’s ancestors, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they share a **common descendant**? That would mean there is some person D such that both Janice and Grace are ancestors of D.\n\nBut Janice is only mentioned as a descendant of Nicholas. No one is said to be Janice’s descendant.\n\nSimilarly, Grace is only mentioned as a descendant of Gloria. No one is said to be Grace’s descendant.\n\nSo they don’t appear to have any known descendants at all in the data. So **option 1 (common descendant)** is unlikely.\n\nNow, **option 2: share a common ancestor**.\n\nWe need to see if any person is an ancestor of both.\n\nLet’s list all ancestors of Janice:\n\n- Nicholas\n- Shirley\n- Madison\n- Victoria\n- Olivia\n\nAncestors of Grace:\n\n- Gloria\n- Kathleen\n- Kyle\n- Daniel\n- Barbara\n\nNow, expand ancestors further if possible.\n\nFor Janice:\n\n- Olivia is Zachary's descendant → so Zachary is an ancestor of Olivia → so Zachary is an ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Edward is Zachary's ancestor → Edward is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Edward is Patricia's descendant → Patricia is ancestor of Edward → so Patricia is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- John is Patricia's ancestor → John is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Pamela is John's ancestor → Pamela is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Emily is Pamela's ancestor → Emily is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Emily is Bruce's descendant → Bruce is ancestor of Emily → so Bruce is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Justin is Bruce's ancestor → Justin is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Lawrence is Justin's ancestor → Lawrence is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Lawrence is Diana's descendant → Diana is ancestor of Lawrence → Diana is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Sharon is Diana's ancestor → Sharon is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Sharon is Ann's descendant → Ann is ancestor of Sharon → Ann is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Ann is Kimberly's descendant → Kimberly is ancestor of Ann → Kimberly is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Denise is Kimberly's ancestor → Denise is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Denise is Joyce's descendant → Joyce is ancestor of Denise → Joyce is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Joyce is Harold's descendant → Harold is ancestor of Joyce → Harold is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Alice is Harold's ancestor → Alice is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Teresa is Alice's ancestor → Teresa is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Teresa is Thomas's descendant → Thomas is ancestor of Teresa → Thomas is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Jean is Thomas's ancestor → Jean is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Jean is Gabriel's descendant → Gabriel is ancestor of Jean → Gabriel is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Billy is Gabriel's ancestor → Billy is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Laura is Billy's ancestor → Laura is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Gary is Laura's ancestor → Gary is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Gary is Gerald's descendant → Gerald is ancestor of Gary → Gerald is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Gerald is Janet's descendant → Janet is ancestor of Gerald → Janet is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Janet is Melissa's descendant → Melissa is ancestor of Janet → Melissa is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Melissa is Evelyn's descendant → Evelyn is ancestor of Melissa → Evelyn is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Evelyn is Henry's descendant → Henry is ancestor of Evelyn → Henry is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Rebecca is Henry's ancestor → Rebecca is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Rebecca is Arthur's descendant → Arthur is ancestor of Rebecca → Arthur is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Russell is Arthur's ancestor → Russell is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Russell is Donald's descendant → Donald is ancestor of Russell → Donald is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Juan is Donald's ancestor → Juan is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Brandon is Juan's ancestor → Brandon is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Brandon is Adam's descendant → Adam is ancestor of Brandon → Adam is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Douglas is Adam's ancestor → Douglas is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Anthony is Douglas's ancestor → Anthony is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Anthony is Frank's descendant → Frank is ancestor of Anthony → Frank is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Frank is Stephanie's descendant → Stephanie is ancestor of Frank → Stephanie is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Stephanie is Mary's descendant → Mary is ancestor of Stephanie → Mary is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Mary is Jordan's descendant → Jordan is ancestor of Mary → Jordan is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- Benjamin is Jordan's ancestor → Benjamin is ancestor of Janice.\n\n- William is Benjamin's descendant → Benjamin is ancestor of William → Wait, this seems contradictory.\n\nHold on: “William is Benjamin's descendant.” So Benjamin → William.\n\nBut also: “Benjamin is Jordan's ancestor.” → Benjamin → Jordan\n\nAnd “Mary is Jordan's descendant.” → Jordan → Mary\n\nSo: Benjamin → Jordan → Mary → Stephanie → Frank → Anthony → Douglas → Adam → Brandon → Juan → Donald → Russell → Arthur → Rebecca → Henry → Evelyn → Melissa → Janet → Gerald → Gary → Laura → Billy → Gabriel → Jean → Thomas → Teresa → Alice → Harold → Joyce → Denise → Kimberly → Ann → Sharon → Diana → Lawrence → Justin → Bruce → Emily → Pamela → John → Patricia → Edward → Zachary → Olivia → Victoria → Madison → Shirley → Nicholas → Janice\n\nSo this is a massive chain! So **Janice is a descendant of Benjamin**.\n\nNow, what about **Grace**? Let's expand Grace’s ancestors further.\n\nGrace ← Gloria ← Kathleen ← Kyle ← Daniel ← Barbara\n\nNow, **Barbara is Bradley's descendant** → Bradley is ancestor of Barbara\n\n**Julie is Bradley's
