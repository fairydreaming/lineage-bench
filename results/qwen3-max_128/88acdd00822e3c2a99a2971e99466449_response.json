are given a long list of lineage relationships (ancestor/descendant statements), and we are to determine the relationship between **Robert** and **Wayne**.\n\nWe must analyze the chain of relationships to see if one is an ancestor/descendant of the other, or if they share a common ancestor or descendant, or none of the above.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract all relationships involving Robert and Wayne.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- **Robert is Natalie's ancestor.**\n- **Thomas is Natalie's descendant.** → So: Robert → Natalie → Thomas\n- **Ann is Thomas's descendant.** → Robert → Natalie → Thomas → Ann\n- **Janice is Ann's descendant.** → ... → Ann → Janice\n- **Elizabeth is Janice's descendant.** → ... → Janice → Elizabeth\n- **Shirley is Elizabeth's descendant.** → ... → Elizabeth →

descendant.**\n- **Christine is Brian's descendant.**\n- **Wayne is Christine's descendant.**\n\nSo we have a path from **Robert → ... → Wayne**?\n\nLet’s trace from **Robert** forward:\n\n- Robert → Natalie\n- Natalie ← Thomas → Ann → Janice → Elizabeth → Shirley → Carol → Philip → Paul → Susan → Roger → Julia\n\nNow from Julia:\n\n- Julia → Pamela → Jacob → Danielle → Ruth\n\nBut that seems to go off in a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another path.\n\nWait, let's look at **Wayne**'s ancestry:\n\nGiven: **Wayne is Christine's descendant.**\n\nSo go backward:\n\n- Wayne
