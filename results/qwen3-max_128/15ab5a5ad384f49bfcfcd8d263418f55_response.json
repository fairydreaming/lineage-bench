Vincent → Sandra → Bobby → Patricia → Brian → Mark → Cheryl → Janice → Natalie → Dorothy → Philip → Denise → Mary → Jose → Peter → Logan → Walter → Rebecca → Marie → Betty → Marilyn → Brandon → Rachel → Victoria → Raymond → Nicole → Sara → Robert → Dylan → Albert → Kathleen → Jason → Patrick → Edward → Laura → Jacqueline → Amber → Ruth → Beverly → Hannah → Andrea → Dennis → Henry → Christopher →

→ Brenda → Jessica → Ashley → Jordan → Kenneth → Linda → Gerald → Andrew → Larry → Kevin → Frank → Judith → Christian → Sean → Sarah → Kathryn → William → Doris → Anthony → Nathan → Amanda → Lisa → Mason → Donald**\n\nWait — that’s a **huge chain**. But is it valid? Let's verify if we can actually connect **Stephanie to Donald** through a continuous ancestor/descendant path.\n\nBut note: the direction matters.\n\nWe have:\n\n- **Stephanie is Alexis's ancestor.**\n- **Alexis is Juan's ancestor.**\n- **Juan is Ann's ancestor.**\n- **Ann → Daniel → Matthew → Bruce → Maria → Grace → Evelyn → Cynthia → Russell → Alice → Melissa → Isabella → Vincent → Sandra → Bobby → Patricia → Brian → Mark → Cheryl → Janice → Natalie → Dorothy → Philip → Denise → Mary → Jose → Peter → Logan → Walter → Rebecca → Marie → Betty → Marilyn → Brandon → Rachel → Victoria → Raymond → Nicole → Sara → Robert → Dylan → Albert → Kathleen → Jason → Patrick → Edward → Laura → Jacqueline → Amber → Ruth → Beverly → Hannah → Andrea → Dennis → Henry → Christopher → Timothy → Abigail → Nicholas → Frances → James → Shirley → Terry → Elizabeth → Ryan → Virginia → Sharon → Heather → Emily → Scott → Michael → Gabriel → Joe → Justin → Catherine → Joshua → Megan → Julie → Debra → John → Eugene → Janet → Randy → Nancy → Samuel → Pamela → Kayla → Deborah → Sophia → Wayne → Tyler → Gregory → Jean → Willie → Karen → George → Brittany → Jack → Roger → Gloria → Diana → Brenda → Jessica → Ashley → Jordan → Kenneth → Linda → Gerald → Andrew → Larry → Kevin → Frank → Judith → Christian → Sean → Sarah → Kathryn → William → Doris → Anthony → Nathan → Amanda → Lisa → Mason → Donald**\n\nThis seems like an **enormous chain** connecting Stephanie all the way to Donald, but we must check **direction consistency**.\n\nEach step must be either:\n- X is Y's ancestor → then Y is X's descendant.\n- So to go from ancestor to descendant, we go **down** the chain.\n- To go from descendant to ancestor, we go **up**.\n\nWe start at **Stephanie**, who is **Alexis's ancestor** → so **Alexis is Stephanie's descendant**.\n\nThen **Alexis is Juan's ancestor** → Juan is Alexis's descendant → so Juan is also Stephanie's descendant (transitively).\n\nContinue:\n\n- Juan → Ann (Juan is Ann's ancestor) → Ann is Juan's descendant → so Ann is Stephanie's descendant.\n- Ann → Daniel (Daniel is Ann's descendant) → OK.\n- Daniel → Matthew (Matthew is Daniel's descendant)\n- Matthew → Bruce (Bruce is Matthew's descendant)\n- Bruce → Maria (Maria is Bruce's descendant)\n- Maria → Grace (Maria is Grace's ancestor) → Wait! This is **reversed**.\n\nHold on! Let's double-check:\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- **Maria is Bruce's descendant.**\n- **Maria is Grace's ancestor.**\n\nSo:\n- Bruce → Maria (Maria is Bruce's descendant)\n- Maria → Grace (Maria is Grace's ancestor) → So Grace is Maria's descendant.\n\nSo chain: Bruce → Maria → Grace\n\nSo far, all are **descendants** from Bruce onward.\n\nBut earlier, we had: Matthew → Bruce → Maria → Grace...\n\nSo that’s fine: all descendants.\n\nContinue:\n\n- Grace → Evelyn?
