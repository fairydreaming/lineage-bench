(We’ll hold off going too far unless needed.)\n\nAlso:\n- **Betty is Elizabeth's ancestor.**\n- **Elizabeth is Dorothy's ancestor.**\n- **Dorothy is Bryan's ancestor.**\n- **Joe is Bryan's descendant.**\n- **Joe is Anna's ancestor.**\n- **Nicole is Anna's descendant.**\n- ... (Again, may not connect.)\n\nBut maybe there's a better path.\n\nLet’s build **Janice’s ancestry** upward:\n\n> Janice → Jordan (ancestor)  \n> Jordan → Roger (ancestor)  \n> Roger → ? (Is Roger someone's descendant?)  \n> Yes: **Roger is Patrick's descendant** → So Patrick is Roger’s ancestor.  \n> Patrick → Joseph (ancestor)  \n> Joseph → Linda (ancestor)  \n> Linda → Ashley (ancestor)  \n> Ashley → Helen (ancestor)  \n> Helen → ?  \n> Helen is Natalie’s descendant → So Natalie is Helen’s ancestor.  \n> Natalie → Katherine (ancestor)  \n> Katherine → Walter (ancestor)\n\nSo Janice’s ancestors include:  \nJordan ← Janice  \nRoger ← Jordan  \nPatrick ← Roger  \nJoseph ← Patrick  \nLinda ← Joseph  \nAshley ← Linda  \nHelen ← Ashley  \nNatalie ← Helen  \nKatherine ← Natalie  \nWalter ← Katherine  \n\nNow, **Betty’s descendants** (going downward):\n\n> Betty → Elizabeth (descendant)  \n> Elizabeth → Dorothy (descendant)  \n> Dorothy → Bryan (descendant)  \n> Bryan → Joe (descendant)  \n> Joe → Anna (descendant)  \n> Anna → Nicole (descendant)\n\nAlso, from other statements:\n- **Joe is Anna's ancestor** → consistent.\n- **Nicole is Anna's descendant** → consistent.\n\nAny connection between these two chains?\n\nLet’s see if any person appears in both Janice’s ancestry and Betty’s descent (or vice versa).\n\nSo far, Janice’s ancestors: Jordan, Roger, Patrick, Joseph, Linda, Ashley, Helen, Natalie, Katherine, Walter.\n\nBetty’s descendants: Elizabeth, Dorothy, Bryan, Joe, Anna, Nicole.\n\nNo overlap yet.\n\nBut maybe we need to go further up from Betty or further down from Janice?\n\nAlternatively, maybe go upward from Betty (who is Betty’s ancestor?) — but we are not given any info about Betty’s ancestors. Only that she is Elizabeth’s ancestor.\n\nSimilarly, do we know any descendants of Janice? Not directly.\n\nAlternative approach: Try to connect through **common individuals** in the entire graph.\n\nLet’s look for any possible bridge between the two family trees.\n\nWe note:\n\n- **Roger is Jordan's ancestor.**\n- **Janice is Jordan's descendant.** → So Janice → Jordan → Roger\n\nAlso:\n- **Roger is Patrick's descendant.** → Patrick → Roger → Jordan → Janice\n\n- **Patrick is Joseph's descendant.** → Joseph → Patrick → Roger → Jordan → Janice\n\n- **Linda is Joseph's ancestor.** → Linda → Joseph → Patrick → Roger → Jordan → Janice\n\n- **Ashley is Linda's ancestor.** → Ashley → Linda → Joseph → ... → Janice\n\n- **Helen is Ashley's ancestor.** → Helen → Ashley → ... → Janice\n\n- **Helen is Natalie's descendant.** → Natalie → Helen → ... → Janice\n\n- **Katherine is Natalie's ancestor.** → Katherine → Natalie → Helen → ... → Janice\n\n- **Walter is Katherine's ancestor.** → Walter → Katherine → ... → Janice\n\nNow, from Betty side:\n\n- **Betty → Elizabeth → Dorothy → Bryan → Joe → Anna → Nicole**\n\nAlso:\n- **Joe is Bryan's descendant** (consistent)\n- **Joe is Anna's ancestor** (so Joe → Anna)\n- **Nicole is Anna's descendant** → Anna → Nicole\n\nAlso:\n- **Joe is Bryan's descendant**, and **Dorothy is Bryan's ancestor**, **Elizabeth is Dorothy's ancestor**, **Betty is Elizabeth's ancestor**\n\nNow, is there any link between **Nicole** (in Betty’s line) and anyone in Janice’s ancestry?\n\nWe have:\n- **Wayne is Nicole's descendant.**\n- **Gabriel is Wayne's descendant.**\n- **Gabriel is Shirley's ancestor.**\n- **Shirley
