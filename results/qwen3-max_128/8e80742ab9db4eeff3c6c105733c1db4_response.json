Denise's descendant.**\n- **Martha is Terry's ancestor.** ← This is key for **Terry**\n  \nSo, **Martha is Terry's ancestor** → **Terry is Martha's descendant**.\n\nAlso: **Martha is Denise's descendant** → So **Denise is Martha's ancestor**, and thus **Denise is also Terry's ancestor** (2 generations up).\n\nAnd: **Virginia is Denise's ancestor** → So **Virginia is Terry's ancestor** (3 generations up).\n\nAnd: **Virginia is Olivia's descendant** → So **Olivia is Virginia's ancestor**, thus **Olivia is Terry's ancestor** (4 generations up).\n\nAnd: **Stephen is Olivia's ancestor** →

thus **Amber is Terry's ancestor**.\n\nAnd: **Amber is Brittany's descendant** → So **Brittany is Amber's ancestor**, thus **Brittany is Terry's ancestor**.\n\nAnd: **Jennifer is Brittany's ancestor** → So **Jennifer is Terry's ancestor**.\n\nAnd: **Jennifer is Randy's ancestor** → So **Randy is Jennifer's descendant**, so **Randy is also in Terry's ancestry line? Wait**, no: **Jennifer is Randy's ancestor**, so **Randy is descendant of Jennifer**, and **Terry is also descendant of Jennifer**, so **Randy and Terry share Jennifer as ancestor**.\n\nBut let's not get lost. The key is: we have a clear chain from **Terry** up to many ancestors.\n\nNow, let's trace **Scott**:\n\n- **Scott is Michael's descendant.**\n- **Rebecca is Michael's ancestor.**\n- **Rebecca is Henry's descendant.**\n- **Henry is Willie's descendant.**\n- **Jessica is Willie's ancestor.**\n- **Jessica is Billy's descendant.**\n- **Sharon is Billy's ancestor.**\n- **Sharon is Bobby's descendant.**\n- **Bobby is Donna's descendant.**\n- **Donna is Frances's descendant.**\n- **Thomas is Frances's ancestor.**\n- **Alan is Thomas's ancestor.**\n- **Alan is Kenneth's descendant.**\n- **Justin is Kenneth's ancestor.**\n- **Mark is Justin's ancestor.**\n- **Austin is Mark's ancestor.**\n- **Mary is Austin's ancestor.**\n- **Paul is Mary's ancestor.**\n- **Samantha is Paul's ancestor.**\n- **Carol is Samantha's ancestor.**\n- **Carol is Raymond's ancestor.**\n- **Jerry is Raymond's descendant.**\n- **Christian is Jerry's descendant.**\n- **Bradley is Christian's descendant.**\n- **Lori is Bradley's descendant.**\n- **Gary is Lori's descendant.**\n- **Walter is Gary's descendant.**\n- **Philip is Walter's descendant.**\n- **Philip is Sandra's ancestor.**\n- **Sandra is Sara's ancestor.**\n- **Sara is Marilyn's ancestor.**\n- **Tyler is Marilyn's descendant.**\n- **Emily is Tyler's descendant.**\n- **Emily is Timothy's ancestor.**\n- **Shirley is Timothy's descendant.**\n- **Shirley is Adam's ancestor.**\n- **Amanda is Adam's descendant.**\n- **Amanda is Eugene's ancestor.**\n- **Eugene is Diana's ancestor.**\n- **Joe is Diana's descendant.**\n- **Benjamin is Joe's descendant.**\n- **Charles is Benjamin's descendant.**\n- **Katherine is Charles's descendant.**\n- **Hannah is Katherine's descendant.**\n- **Janice is Hannah's descendant.**\n- **Abigail is Janice's descendant.**\n- **Abigail is Deborah's ancestor.**\n- **Deborah is Jordan's ancestor.**\n- **Jacqueline is Jordan's descendant.**\n- **Jacqueline is Mason's ancestor.**\n- **Anthony is Mason's descendant.**\n- **Kayla is Anthony's descendant.**\n- **Kayla is Jeffrey's ancestor.**\n- **Jeffrey is Noah's ancestor.**\n- **Nancy is Noah's descendant.**\n- **Logan is Nancy's descendant.**\n- **Ann is Logan's descendant.**\n- **Gregory is Ann's descendant.**\n- **Gregory is Gerald's ancestor.**\n- **Gerald is Jacob's ancestor.**\n- **Jacob is Patricia's ancestor.**\n- **Patricia is Jeremy's ancestor.**\n- **Jeremy is John's ancestor.**\n- **John is Lauren's ancestor.**\n- **Lauren is Judith's ancestor.**\n- **Brandon is Judith's descendant.**\n- **Natalie is Brandon's descendant.**\n- **Brian is Natalie's descendant.**\n- **Brian is Madison's ancestor.**\n- **Madison is Kelly's ancestor.**\n- **Kelly is Theresa's ancestor.**\n- **George is Theresa's descendant.**\n- **George is Doris's ancestor.**\n- **Doris is Joan's ancestor.**\n- **Alexander is Joan's descendant.**\n- **Michelle is Alexander's descendant.**\n- **Michelle is Kathryn's ancestor.**\n- **Kathryn is Bruce's ancestor.**\n- **Bruce is Joseph's ancestor.**\n- **Joseph is Jean's ancestor.**\n- **Jean is Frank's ancestor.**\n- **Frank is Christina's ancestor.**\n- **Joshua is Christina's descendant.**\n- **Wayne is Joshua's descendant.**\n- **Julia is Wayne's descendant.**\n- **Nicole is Julia's descendant.**\n- **Catherine is Nicole's descendant.**\n- **Steven is Catherine's descendant.**\n- **Steven is Pamela's ancestor.**\n- **Pamela is Ryan's ancestor.**\n- **Ryan is Cynthia's ancestor.**\n- **Cynthia is Carl's ancestor.**\n- **Isabella is Carl's descendant.**\n- **Isabella is Cheryl's ancestor.**\n- **Cheryl is Russell's ancestor.**\n- **Russell is Patrick's ancestor.**\n- **Zachary is Patrick's descendant.**\n- **Zachary is Roy's ancestor.**\n- **Megan is Roy's descendant.**\n- **Megan is Anna's ancestor.**\n- **Anna is Elijah's ancestor.**\n- **Dennis is Elijah's descendant.**\n- **Dennis is Charlotte's ancestor.**\n- **Heather is Charlotte's descendant.**\n- **Heather is Andrew's ancestor.**\n- **Nicholas is Andrew's descendant.**\n- **William is Nicholas's descendant.**\n- **Lisa is William's descendant.**\n- **Randy is Lisa's descendant.**\n- **Jennifer is Randy's ancestor.**\n- **Jennifer is Brittany's ancestor.**\n- **Amber is Brittany's descendant.**\n- **Sean is Amber's descendant.**\n- **Vincent is Sean's descendant.**\n- **Susan is Vincent's descendant.**\n- **Susan is Harold's ancestor.**\n- **Laura is Harold's descendant.**\n- **Laura is Albert's ancestor.**\n- **Linda is Albert's descendant.**\n- **Samuel is Linda's descendant.**\n- **Samuel is Kyle's ancestor.**\n- **Kyle is Stephen's ancestor.**\n- **Stephen is Olivia's ancestor.**\n- **Virginia is Olivia's descendant.**\n- **Virginia is Denise's ancestor.**\n- **Martha is Denise's descendant.**\n- **Martha is Terry's ancestor.**\n\nWait!
