**Connecting the Lines:**

*   We also know Laura is Anna's ancestor, and Anna is Christopher's ancestor, Christopher is Joyce's ancestor, and Joyce is Lauren's ancestor.
*   Finally, Lauren is Amanda's ancestor.

This means that Amanda is a descendant of Laura, and Laura is an ancestor of Anna. Since Frank is Amanda's descendant, and Scott is a descendant of Frank, Scott's lineage traces back to Laura.

However, Diane's lineage, as far as we can trace it, goes through Wayne and Bradley to Danielle. There's no connection established between Danielle and Laura or any of Scott's ancestors.

Based on the given information, we cannot establish a direct ancestor-descendant relationship between Scott and Diane. We also cannot determine if they share a common ancestor or descendant.
