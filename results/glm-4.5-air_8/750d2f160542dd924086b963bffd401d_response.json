Terry and Joshua share a common ancestor.\n    *   Is there someone who is an ancestor of both Terry and Joshua? The given information doesn't state this. We know Terry is an ancestor of Kenneth, and Joshua is an ancestor of Kenneth, but we don't know if Terry and Joshua have a common ancestor. For example, Terry could be Kenneth's great-great-grandmother, and Joshua could be Kenneth's great-great-grandfather on the other side of the family. They might not share a common ancestor. So this is not necessarily true.\n2.  Terry is Joshua's ancestor.\n    *   The path is `Joshua -> ... -> Kenneth`. The path is `Terry -> ... -> Kenneth`. There is no path from Terry to Joshua or Joshua to Terry that establishes one as the ancestor of the other. They are both ancestors of Kenneth, but not of each other. So this is false.\n3.  Terry and Joshua share a common descendant.\n    *   As established, both are ancestors of Kenneth. Therefore, Kenneth is a common descendant of both Terry and Joshua. This statement is true.\n4.  Terry is Joshua's descendant.\n    *   Similar to option 2, there is no lineage path that makes Terry a descendant of Joshua. This is false.\n5.  None of the above is correct.\n    *   Since option 3 is correct, this is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3.\n\nLet's double-check the logic.\n- `Terry -> Madison -> Kenneth`\n- `Joshua -> Christine -> Patrick -> Ethan -> Benjamin -> Kenneth`\n\nThis means:\n- Terry is an ancestor of Madison.\n- Madison is an ancestor of Kenneth.\n- Therefore, Terry is an ancestor of Kenneth. (Transitive property)\n- Joshua is an ancestor of Christine.\n- Christine is an ancestor of Patrick.\n- Patrick is an ancestor of Ethan.\n- Ethan is an ancestor of Benjamin.\n- Benjamin is an ancestor of Kenneth.\n- Therefore, Joshua is an ancestor of Kenneth. (Transitive property)\n\nSince both Terry and Joshua are ancestors of Kenneth, it follows that Kenneth is a descendant of both Terry and Joshua. By definition, if two individuals have a common descendant, they share that descendant.\n\nThe question asks for the relationship between Terry and Joshua.\n- We have established that Kenneth is a descendant of Terry (`Terry -> ... -> Kenneth`).\n- We have established that Kenneth is a descendant of Joshua (`Joshua -> ... -> Kenneth`).\n- Therefore, Kenneth is a common descendant of Terry and Joshua.\n\nLet's re-evaluate option 1: \"Terry and Joshua share a common ancestor.\"\n- This would mean there exists a person X such that `X -> Terry` and `X -> Joshua`.\n- The provided information does not give us any such person. We know their paths converge on Kenneth, a *descendant*, not an *ancestor*. For example, Terry could be Kenneth's maternal line and Joshua could be Kenneth's paternal line. They share a descendant (Kenneth) but not necessarily a common ancestor. So option 1 is not correct.\n\nThe logic seems sound. The conclusion that Terry and Joshua share a common descendant (Kenneth) is directly supported by the transitive application of the given lineage relationships.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  **Parse relationships:**\n    *   B -> K\n    *   J -> C\n    *   M -> K\n    *   P -> E\n    *   C -> P\n    *   E -> B\n    *   T -> M\n2.  **Synthesize lineage chains:**\n    *   Chain 1 (Terry): T -> M -> K\n    *   Chain 2 (Joshua): J -> C -> P -> E -> B -> K\n3.  **Identify the common link:** Both chains terminate at Kenneth (K). This means both T and J are ancestors of K.\n4.  **Determine the relationship between T and J:**\n    *   Since T is an ancestor of K, and J is an ancestor of K, K is a common descendant of T and J.\n    *   Therefore, T and J share a common descendant.\n5.  **Evaluate options:**\n    *   1.
