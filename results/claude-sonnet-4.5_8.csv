- Mason is Kelly's descendant (given)
- Maria is Mason's descendant (from ""Mason is Maria's ancestor"")

Let me trace the lineage chain from the given relationships:

1. **Janet → Michael** (Janet is Michael's ancestor)
2. **Michael → Jason** (Michael is Jason's ancestor)
3. **Jason → Dorothy** (Jason is Dorothy's ancestor)
4. **Dorothy → Theresa** (Theresa is Dorothy's descendant, so Dorothy is Theresa's ancestor)
5. **Theresa → Andrea** (Andrea is Theresa's descendant, so Theresa is Andrea's ancestor)
6. **Andrea → Nicholas** (Nicholas is Andrea's descendant, so Andrea is Nicholas's ancestor)
7. **Nicholas → Frances** (Frances is Nicholas's descendant, so Nicholas is Frances's ancestor)

Following the complete chain:
**Janet → Michael → Jason → Dorothy → Theresa → Andrea → Nicholas → Frances**

This shows that Janet is an ancestor of Frances, which means Frances is a descendant of Janet.

Let me build the lineage chain using the notation: Ancestor → Descendant

**Chain 1 (involving Scott):**
- Scott is Rachel's descendant: Rachel → Scott
- Rachel is Jesse's descendant: Jesse → Rachel
- Jesse is Kevin's descendant: Kevin → Jesse
- Kevin is Walter's descendant: Walter → Kevin

This gives us: **Walter → Kevin → Jesse → Rachel → Scott**

**Chain 2 (involving Doris):**
- Helen is Doris's ancestor: Helen → Doris
- Helen is Jacob's descendant: Jacob → Helen
- Walter is Jacob's ancestor: Walter → Jacob

This gives us: **Walter → Jacob → Helen → Doris**

**Combined view:**
```
Walter
├─→ Kevin → Jesse → Rachel → Scott
└─→ Jacob → Helen → Doris
```

From this diagram, I can see that:
- Walter is an ancestor of Scott (through the chain: Walter → Kevin → Jesse → Rachel → Scott)
- Walter is an ancestor of Doris (through the chain: Walter → Jacob → Helen → Doris)
- Therefore, **Scott and Doris share Walter as a common ancestor**

Let me use the notation A → B to mean ""A is an ancestor of B.""

From the given statements, I can establish:

**Chain 1 (involving Joshua):**
- Statement 2: Joshua → Christine (Christine is Joshua's descendant)
- Statement 5: Christine → Patrick (Christine is Patrick's ancestor)
- Statement 4: Patrick → Ethan (Ethan is Patrick's descendant)
- Statement 6: Ethan → Benjamin (Ethan is Benjamin's ancestor)
- Statement 1: Benjamin → Kenneth (Benjamin is Kenneth's ancestor)

Therefore: **Joshua → Christine → Patrick → Ethan → Benjamin → Kenneth**

**Chain 2 (involving Terry):**
- Statement 7: Terry → Madison (Madison is Terry's descendant)
- Statement 3: Madison → Kenneth (Kenneth is Madison's descendant)

Therefore: **Terry → Madison → Kenneth**

Now I can analyze the relationship between Terry and Joshua:

From Chain 1: Joshua is an ancestor of Kenneth
From Chain 2: Terry is an ancestor of Kenneth

This means **Kenneth is a descendant of both Terry and Joshua**.

Therefore, Terry and Joshua share a common descendant (Kenneth).

Let me verify the other options:
1. Common ancestor - No evidence they share a common ancestor
2. Terry is Joshua's ancestor - No path from Terry to Joshua
4. Terry is Joshua's descendant - No path from Joshua to Terry

This shows a direct lineage path from Samantha to Donald, with multiple generations in between.

Therefore, **Samantha is Donald's ancestor** (or equivalently, Donald is Samantha's descendant).

- Combined: Sara → Peter → George

**Extending to Richard and Christian:**

**Adding Victoria:**

**Now connecting Maria and Diane:**
- Maria is Sara's ancestor: Maria → Sara
- Maria is Diane's descendant: Diane → Maria

4. Gloria is Joe's ancestor: Gloria → Joe

Now I can chain these relationships:

I can see that:
- From statements 1, 3, 4: Samuel → Jason → Gloria → Joe
- From statement 6: Samuel → Alan

Both paths start from **Samuel**, meaning:

- Rebecca descends from Samuel through the line: Samuel → Alan → Barbara → Sophia → Rebecca

Joe and Rebecca are on different branches descending from Samuel.

Checking each option:

**Analysis:**

I now have two paths to Mason:

- **Path 2:** Angela → Mason

This shows that:
- Mason is a descendant of Brittany (through Christina and others)
- Mason is a descendant of Angela (directly stated)
