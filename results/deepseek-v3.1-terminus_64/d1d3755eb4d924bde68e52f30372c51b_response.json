From 12: Edward → Deborah\n\nAnd from 32: Jordan → Edward\n\nFrom 57: Alice → Jordan\n\nFrom the chain from Shirley: Shirley → Patricia → Jason → Robert → Amy → Brittany → Alice → Jordan → Edward → Deborah\n\nSo Deborah is connected through that chain.\n\nNow, where is Judith connected? Judith → Gary → Ann → Joseph → Ethan → Bobby → Dorothy → Julie → Margaret → Frank → Amanda → Diane → Christine → Wayne → Elijah → Samuel → Roger → Abigail → George → Harold → Kayla → Philip → ... but this chain goes to Kathleen, which might connect to others, but let's see if Judith and Deborah share a connection.\n\nFrom Judith's chain, we have Ethan → Bobby, and from Deborah's chain, we have Alice → Jordan → Edward → Deborah.\n\nBut from Brittany → Alice, and Amy → Brittany, and Robert → Amy, etc., but is there a connection between Ethan and Alice? Or between Bobby and Alice?\n\nFrom the statements, we have \"Ethan is Bobby's ancestor\" so Ethan → Bobby.\n\nBut also, from Deborah's chain, Alice is involved, and from Judith's chain, Bobby is involved.\n\nIs there a direct link between Bobby and Alice? From 57: Alice → Jordan, and from 32: Jordan → Edward, but no direct link to Bobby.\n\nBut from 20: Bobby → Dorothy, and from 5: Dorothy → Julie, and from 29: Julie → Margaret, and from 42: Margaret → Frank, and from 50: Frank → Amanda, and from 4: Amanda → Diane, and from 23: Diane → Christine, and so on, but that chain goes to Roger and Abigail, etc.\n\nFrom Deborah's chain, we have Alice → Jordan → Edward → Deborah.\n\nBut from Judith's chain, we have Ethan → Bobby, and Bobby is connected to Dorothy, etc.\n\nBut is there a common point? Let's see if there is a common ancestor or descendant.\n\nPerhaps I need to find if Judith is an ancestor of Deborah or vice versa, or if they share a common ancestor.\n\nLet me list all the ancestors and descendants in a structured way.\n\nI recall that in such problems, sometimes we need to find the direction of the lineage.\n\nLet me try to start from Judith and see if I can reach Deborah through the chain.\n\nFrom Judith: Judith → Gary (1)\n\nGary → Ann (41)\n\nAnn → Joseph (34)\n\nJoseph → Ethan (47)\n\nEthan → Bobby (from \"Ethan is Bobby's ancestor\")\n\nBobby → Dorothy (20)\n\nDorothy → Julie (5)\n\nJulie → Margaret (29)\n\nMargaret → Frank (42)\n\nFrank → Amanda (50)\n\nAmanda → Diane (4)\n\nDiane → Christine (23)\n\nChristine → Wayne (51? from \"Wayne is Christine's descendant\" so Christine → Wayne)\n\nWayne → Elijah (10)\n\nElijah → Samuel (7)\n\nSamuel → Roger (48)\n\nRoger → Abigail (56)\n\nAbigail → George (61? from \"George is Abigail's descendant\" so Abigail → George)\n\nGeorge → Harold (39)\n\nHarold → Kayla (52)\n\nKayla → Philip (59)\n\nNow, from Philip, we have Philip → Matthew (62)\n\nBut Matthew → Grace (30), etc., but where does this lead? To Kathleen, but we need Deborah.\n\nFrom Philip, we can go to Matthew, but let's see if Philip connects to Deborah.\n\nFrom Deborah, we have Edward → Deborah (12)\n\nEdward ← Jordan (32) so Jordan → Edward\n\nJordan ← Alice (57) so Alice → Jordan\n\nAlice ← Brittany (8) so Brittany → Alice\n\nBrittany ← Amy (43) so Amy → Brittany\n\nAmy ← Robert (38) so Robert → Amy\n\nRobert ← Jason (27) so Jason → Robert\n\nJason ← Patricia (58) so Patricia → Jason\n\nPatricia ← Shirley (53) so Shirley → Patricia\n\nShirley ← Jesse (9) so Jesse → Shirley\n\nJesse ← Michelle (11) so Michelle → Jesse\n\nMichelle ← Henry (18) so Henry → Michelle\n\nHenry ← Lauren (33) so Lauren → Henry\n\nLauren ← Emily (21) so Emily → Lauren\n\nEmily ← Denise (14) so Denise → Emily\n\nDenise ← Russell (25) so Russell → Denise\n\nRussell ← Sarah (16) so Sarah → Russell\n\nSarah ← Gerald (54) so Gerald → Sarah\n\nGerald ← Bryan (36) so Bryan → Gerald\n\nBryan ← Ruth (26) so Ruth → Bryan\n\nRuth ← Christian (44) so Christian → Ruth\n\nChristian ← Gloria (55) so Gloria → Christian\n\nGloria ← Hannah (60) so Hannah → Gloria\n\nHannah ← Joyce (28) so Joyce → Hannah\n\nJoyce ← Patrick (46) so Patrick → Joyce\n\nPatrick ← Eric (22) so Eric → Patrick\n\nEric ← Beverly (19) so Beverly → Eric\n\nBeverly ← John (17) so John → Beverly\n\nJohn ← William (2) so William → John\n\nWilliam ← Kathleen (49) so Kathleen → William\n\nKathleen ← Elizabeth (3) so Elizabeth → Kathleen\n\nElizabeth ← Cheryl (40) so Cheryl → Elizabeth\n\nCheryl ← Austin (6) so Austin → Cheryl\n\nAustin ← Jose (13) so Jose → Austin\n\nJose ← Douglas (15) so Douglas → Jose\n\nDouglas ← Megan (24) so Megan → Douglas\n\nMegan ← Zachary (37) so Zachary → Megan\n\nZachary ← Nathan (45) so Nathan → Zachary\n\nNathan ← Janet (35) so Janet → Nathan\n\nJanet ← Grace (31) so Grace → Janet\n\nGrace ← Matthew (30) so Matthew → Grace\n\nMatthew ← Philip (62) so Philip → Matthew\n\nSo from Deborah, we have a chain back to Philip, but from Judith's chain, we also go to Philip? From Judith's chain, we have Kayla → Philip, so from Judith, we have Philip in the chain.\n\nFrom Judith: ... Harold → Kayla → Philip\n\nFrom Deborah: ... Philip → Matthew → ... so indeed, Philip is a common point.\n\nBut is Philip an ancestor or descendant? In Judith's chain, Philip is a descendant of Judith? Let's see the direction.\n\nFrom Judith: Judith → Gary → Ann → Joseph → Ethan → Bobby → Dorothy → Julie → Margaret → Frank → Amanda → Diane → Christine → Wayne → Elijah → Samuel → Roger → Abigail → George → Harold → Kayla → Philip\n\nSo Judith is an ancestor of Philip.\n\nFrom Deborah: Deborah is a descendant of Philip? From Deborah's chain: Philip → Matthew → Grace → Janet → Nathan → Zachary → Megan → Douglas → Jose → Austin → Cheryl → Elizabeth → Kathleen → William → John → Beverly → Eric → Patrick → Joyce → Hannah → Gloria → Christian → Ruth → Bryan → Gerald → Sarah → Russell → Denise → Emily → Lauren → Henry → Michelle → Jesse → Shirley → Patricia → Jason → Robert → Amy → Brittany → Alice → Jordan → Edward → Deborah\n\nSo yes, Philip is an ancestor of Deborah.\n\nTherefore, since Judith is an ancestor of Philip, and Philip is an ancestor of Deborah, then Judith is an ancestor of Deborah.\n\nSo Judith → Philip → Deborah, meaning Judith is Deborah's ancestor.\n\nTherefore, the relationship is that Judith is Deborah's ancestor.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n1. Judith and Deborah share a common ancestor.\n\n2. Judith is Deborah's descendant.\n\n3. Judith and Deborah share a common descendant.\n\n4. Judith is Deborah's ancestor.\n\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nSo option 4 seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check if the chain is correct. I might have missed something.\n\nFrom Judith to Philip: we have Judith → Gary → Ann → Joseph → Ethan → Bobby → Dorothy → Julie → Margaret → Frank → Amanda → Diane → Christine → Wayne → Elijah → Samuel → Roger → Abigail → George → Harold → Kayla → Philip\n\nIs all this connected? Let's verify the links.\n\n- Judith → Gary: given\n\n- Gary → Ann: from \"Ann is Gary's descendant\" so Gary → Ann\n\n- Ann → Joseph: from \"Ann is Joseph's ancestor\" so Ann → Joseph\n\n- Joseph →

From 47: Joseph → Ethan, so Ann → Joseph → Ethan.\n\nNow, what is Ethan? From the last statement: \"Ethan is Bobby's ancestor\" so Ethan → Bobby.\n\nAnd from 20: Bobby → Dorothy\n\nFrom 5: Dorothy → Julie\n\nFrom 29: Julie → Margaret\n\nFrom 42: Margaret → Frank\n\nFrom 50: Frank → Amanda\n\nFrom 4: Amanda → Diane\n\nFrom 23: Diane → Christine\n\nFrom 51: Christine → Wayne → Elijah → Samuel → Roger\n\nFrom 56: Roger → Abigail\n\nFrom 61: Abigail → George → Harold → Kayla → Philip\n\nBut from 62, we have Philip → Matthew → ... but that chain goes to Kathleen, etc.\n\nBut we need Deborah. Where is Deborah? From 12: Edward → Deborah\n\nAnd from 32: Jordan → Edward\n\nFrom 57: Alice → Jordan\n\nFrom the chain from Shirley: Shirley → Patricia → Jason → Robert → Amy → Brittany → Alice → Jordan → Edward → Deborah\n\nSo Deborah is connected through that chain.\n\nNow, where is Judith connected? Judith → Gary → Ann → Joseph → Ethan → Bobby → Dorothy → Julie → Margaret → Frank → Amanda → Diane → Christine → Wayne → Elijah → Samuel → Roger → Abigail → George → Harold → Kayla → Philip → ... but this chain goes to Kathleen, which might connect to others, but let's see if Judith and Deborah share a connection.\n\nFrom Judith's chain, we have Ethan → Bobby, and from Deborah's chain, we have Alice → Jordan → Edward → Deborah.\n\nBut from Brittany → Alice, and Amy → Brittany, and Robert → Amy, etc., but is there a connection between Ethan and Alice? Or between Bobby and Alice?\n\nFrom the statements, we have \"Ethan is Bobby's ancestor\" so Ethan → Bobby.\n\nBut also, from Deborah's chain, Alice is involved, and from Judith's chain, Bobby is involved.\n\nIs there a direct link between Bobby and Alice? From 57: Alice → Jordan, and from 32: Jordan → Edward, but no direct link to Bobby.\n\nBut from 20: Bobby → Dorothy, and from 5: Dorothy → Julie, and from 29: Julie → Margaret, and from 42: Margaret → Frank, and from 50: Frank → Amanda, and from 4: Amanda → Diane, and from 23: Diane → Christine, and so on, but that chain goes to Roger and Abigail, etc.\n\nFrom Deborah's chain, we have Alice → Jordan → Edward → Deborah.\n\nBut from Judith's chain, we have Ethan → Bobby, and Bobby is connected to Dorothy, etc.\n\nBut is there a common point? Let's see if there is a common ancestor or descendant.\n\nPerhaps I need to find if Judith is an ancestor of Deborah or vice versa, or if they share a common ancestor.\n\nLet me list all the ancestors and descendants in a structured way.\n\nI recall that in such problems, sometimes we need to find the direction of the lineage.\n\nLet me try to start from Judith and see if I can reach Deborah through the chain.\n\nFrom Judith: Judith → Gary (1)\n\nGary → Ann (41)\n\nAnn → Joseph (34)\n\nJoseph → Ethan (47)\n\nEthan → Bobby (from \"Ethan is Bobby's ancestor\")\n\nBobby → Dorothy (20)\n\nDorothy → Julie (5)\n\nJulie → Margaret (29)\n\nMargaret → Frank (42)\n\nFrank → Amanda (50)\n\nAmanda → Diane (4)\n\nDiane → Christine (23)\n\nChristine → Wayne (51? from \"Wayne is Christine's descendant\" so Christine → Wayne)\n\nWayne → Elijah (10)\n\nElijah → Samuel (7)\n\nSamuel → Roger (48)\n\nRoger → Abigail (56)\n\nAbigail → George (61? from \"George is Abigail's descendant\" so Abigail → George)\n\nGeorge → Harold (39)\n\nHarold → Kayla (52)\n\nKayla → Philip (59)\n\nNow, from Philip, we have Philip → Matthew (62)\n\nBut Matthew → Grace (30), etc., but where does this lead? To Kathleen, but we need Deborah.\n\nFrom Philip, we can go to Matthew, but let's see if Philip connects to Deborah.\n\nFrom Deborah, we have Edward → Deborah (12)\n\nEdward ← Jordan (32) so Jordan → Edward\n\nJordan ← Alice (57) so Alice → Jordan\n\nAlice ← Brittany (8) so Brittany → Alice\n\nBrittany ← Amy (43) so Amy → Brittany\n\nAmy ← Robert (38) so Robert → Amy\n\nRobert ← Jason (27) so Jason → Robert\n\nJason ← Patricia (58) so Patricia → Jason\n\nPatricia ← Shirley (53) so Shirley → Patricia\n\nShirley ← Jesse (9) so Jesse → Shirley\n\nJesse ← Michelle (11) so Michelle → Jesse\n\nMichelle ← Henry (18) so Henry → Michelle\n\nHenry ← Lauren (33) so Lauren → Henry\n\nLauren ← Emily (21) so Emily → Lauren\n\nEmily ← Denise (14) so Denise → Emily\n\nDenise ← Russell (25) so Russell → Denise\n\nRussell ← Sarah (16) so Sarah → Russell\n\nSarah ← Gerald (54) so Gerald → Sarah\n\nGerald ← Bryan (36) so Bryan → Gerald\n\nBryan ← Ruth (26) so Ruth → Bryan\n\nRuth ← Christian (44) so Christian → Ruth\n\nChristian ← Gloria (55) so Gloria → Christian\n\nGloria ← Hannah (60) so Hannah → Gloria\n\nHannah ← Joyce (28) so Joyce → Hannah\n\nJoyce ← Patrick (46) so Patrick → Joyce\n\nPatrick ← Eric (22) so Eric → Patrick\n\nEric ← Beverly (19) so Beverly → Eric\n\nBeverly ← John (17) so John → Beverly\n\nJohn ← William (2) so William → John\n\nWilliam ← Kathleen (49) so Kathleen → William\n\nKathleen ← Elizabeth (3) so Elizabeth → Kathleen\n\nElizabeth ← Cheryl (40) so Cheryl → Elizabeth\n\nCheryl ← Austin (6) so Austin → Cheryl\n\nAustin ← Jose (13) so Jose → Austin\n\nJose ← Douglas (15) so Douglas → Jose\n\nDouglas ← Megan (24) so Megan → Douglas\n\nMegan ← Zachary (37) so Zachary → Megan\n\nZachary ← Nathan (45) so Nathan → Zachary\n\nNathan ← Janet (35) so Janet → Nathan\n\nJanet ← Grace (31) so Grace → Janet\n\nGrace ← Matthew (30) so Matthew → Grace\n\nMatthew ← Philip (62) so Philip → Matthew\n\nSo from Deborah, we have a chain back to Philip, but from Judith's chain, we also go to Philip? From Judith's chain, we have Kayla → Philip, so from Judith, we have Philip in the chain.\n\nFrom Judith: ... Harold → Kayla → Philip\n\nFrom Deborah: ... Philip → Matthew → ... so indeed, Philip is a common point.\n\nBut is Philip an ancestor or descendant? In Judith's chain, Philip is a descendant of Judith? Let's see the direction.\n\nFrom Judith: Judith → Gary → Ann → Joseph → Ethan → Bobby → Dorothy → Julie → Margaret → Frank → Amanda → Diane → Christine → Wayne → Elijah → Samuel → Roger → Abigail → George → Harold → Kayla → Philip\n\nSo Judith is an ancestor of Philip.\n\nFrom Deborah: Deborah is a descendant of Philip? From Deborah's chain: Philip → Matthew → Grace → Janet → Nathan → Zachary → Megan → Douglas → Jose → Austin → Cheryl → Elizabeth → Kathleen → William → John → Beverly → Eric → Patrick → Joyce → Hannah → Gloria → Christian → Ruth → Bryan → Gerald → Sarah → Russell → Denise → Emily → Lauren → Henry → Michelle → Jesse → Shirley → Patricia → Jason → Robert → Amy → Brittany → Alice → Jordan → Edward → Deborah\n\nSo yes, Philip is an ancestor of Deborah.\n\nTherefore, since Judith is an ancestor of Philip, and Philip is an ancestor of Deborah, then Judith is an ancestor of Deborah.\n\nSo Judith → Philip → Deborah, meaning Judith is Deborah's ancestor.\n\nTherefore, the relationship is that Judith is Deborah's ancestor.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n1. Judith and Deborah share a common ancestor.\n\n2. Judith is Deborah's descendant.\n\n3. Judith and Deborah share a common descendant.\n\n4. Judith is Deborah's ancestor.\n\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nSo option 4 seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check if the chain is correct. I might have missed something.\n\nFrom Judith to Philip: we have Judith → Gary → Ann → Joseph → Ethan → Bobby → Dorothy → Julie → Margaret → Frank → Amanda → Diane → Christine → Wayne → Elijah → Samuel → Roger → Abigail → George → Harold → Kayla → Philip\n\nIs all this connected? Let's verify the links.\n\n- Judith → Gary: given\n\n- Gary → Ann: from \"Ann is Gary's descendant\" so Gary → Ann\n\n- Ann → Joseph: from \"Ann is Joseph's ancestor\" so Ann → Joseph\n\n- Joseph →
