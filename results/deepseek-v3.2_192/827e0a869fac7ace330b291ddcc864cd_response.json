We need to determine the relationship between Terry and John. The options are: common descendant, common ancestor, Terry is John's ancestor, Terry is John's descendant, or none.\n\nWe must trace the relationships. Let's parse the information. We have many statements of the form \"X is Y's descendant.\" or \"X is Y's ancestor.\" Note: \"X is Y's descendant\" means Y is an ancestor of X. \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X is an ancestor of Y.\n\nWe need to find a chain connecting Terry and John. Let's list all statements that involve Terry or John.\n\nFirst, find Terry: \n- \"Terry is Brittany's descendant.\" \n- Also maybe other statements where Terry is mentioned? Search for Terry: only that one.\n\nNow John:\n- \"Keith is John's descendant.\" That means John is an ancestor of Keith.\n- Also maybe other? Search for John: only that one? Also \"John\" appears in \"John's descendant\" but only that.\n\nSo we need to connect Terry to John. We need to use intermediate people.\n\nLet's restate the goal: Determine the relationship between Terry and John. Possibly we can find a path from Terry to John or vice versa.\n\nWe can treat these as directed edges: if X is Y's descendant, then there is an edge from Y to X (Y -> X means Y is ancestor of X). If X is Y's ancestor, then there is an edge from X to Y (X -> Y means X is ancestor of Y).\n\nSo we have many relationships. We can try to build a graph. But with so many, we might find a chain by focusing on names that appear frequently.\n\nLet's extract all relationships in a more systematic way. I'll denote \"descendant\" as \"child\" (but careful: descendant could be more than one generation, but we treat it as a direct or indirect parent-child. Actually, it's a transitive relationship. So we can treat each statement as a fact that there is a directed path from the ancestor to the descendant. But we don't know exact generations, so we can only infer ancestral relationships.\n\nWe need to find if there is a path from Terry to John, or John to Terry, or if they have a common ancestor/descendant.\n\nLet's list all statements in two forms: Ancestor -> Descendant.\n\nFor each statement:\n\n1.
