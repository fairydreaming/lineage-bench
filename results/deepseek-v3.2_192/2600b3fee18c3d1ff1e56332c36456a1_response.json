The task is to determine the lineage relationship between Amanda and Adam. We need to select from the options: \n1. They share a common ancestor.\n2. They share a common descendant.\n3. Amanda is Adam's ancestor.\n4. Amanda is Adam's descendant.\n5. None of the above.\n\nWe have to trace connections between Amanda and Adam using the given relationships. We'll treat the relationships as directed edges in a family tree graph: for each statement \"X is Y's descendant\" or \"X is Y's ancestor\", we can interpret it as a parent-child relationship? Actually careful: \"X is Y's descendant\" means Y is an ancestor of X. Alternatively, \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X is an ancestor of Y. So we have two types of statements:\n- \"A is B's descendant.\" -> B is ancestor of A.\n- \"A is B's ancestor.\" -> A is ancestor of B.\n\nWe can represent these as directed edges from ancestor to descendant. So if \"A is B's descendant\", then edge B -> A. If \"A is B's ancestor\", then edge A -> B.\n\nWe need to find if there is a path from Adam to Amanda or vice versa, or if they have a common ancestor or common descendant.\n\nWe have many names. Let's extract all relevant statements that might connect Amanda and Adam.\n\nFirst, find statements that mention Amanda: \n- \"Amanda is Katherine's descendant.\" (from: \"Amanda is Katherine's descendant.\" Actually given: \"Amanda is Katherine's descendant.\" I see in the list: \"Amanda is Katherine's descendant.\" That's directly stated?

So Katherine -> Amanda.\n- Adam is Emma's ancestor. So Adam -> Emma.\n\nWe need to connect Amanda and Adam. We can try to find a chain from Adam to Amanda or from Amanda to Adam, or find common ancestors/descendants.\n\nLet's see if there is a path from Adam to Katherine or from Emma to Amanda, etc.\n\nWe have many relationships. We'll try to build connections step by step.\n\nWe can also list all relationships that involve Katherine and Emma, and then expand.\n\nFirst, Katherine appears in:\n- Amanda is Katherine's descendant. (Katherine -> Amanda)\n- Anthony is Katherine's ancestor. (Anthony -> Katherine) So Anthony is ancestor of Katherine.\n\nSo we have Anthony -> Katherine -> Amanda.\n\nNow, who is Anthony connected to?\n- Richard is Anthony's ancestor. (Richard -> Anthony)\nSo Richard -> Anthony -> Katherine -> Amanda.\n\nAlso, maybe other connections to Katherine? Not directly. But we have: \n- Anthony is Katherine's ancestor? Wait: \"Anthony is Katherine's ancestor.\" means Anthony -> Katherine. So yes.\n\nNow, what about Adam? Adam is Emma's ancestor: Adam -> Emma.\nWhat about Emma? \n- Emma is Randy's ancestor. (Emma -> Randy)\n- Also: \"Adam is Emma's ancestor.\" So Adam -> Emma -> Randy.\n\nRandy appears in:\n- Randy is Sharon's ancestor. (Randy -> Sharon)\n- Emma is Randy's ancestor. (Emma -> Randy)\n\nSharon appears in:\n- Sharon is Stephen's ancestor. (Sharon -> Stephen)\n- Randy is Sharon's ancestor. (Randy -> Sharon)\n\nStephen appears in:\n- Debra is Stephen's descendant. (Stephen -> Debra)\n- Sharon is Stephen's ancestor. (Sharon -> Stephen)\n\nAlso, maybe other connections from Emma? Not directly.\n\nWe need to see if there is a connection between the chain from Adam (downwards) and the chain to Amanda (upwards or downwards). Alternatively, they might share a common ancestor or descendant.\n\nWe could try to see if Amanda is in the descendant line of Adam, or if Adam is in the descendant line of Amanda, or if there is some overlap.\n\nWe have many names; perhaps we can find a connection through other people. \n\nLet's try to see if there is a link between Katherine (or Anthony) and Emma (or Adam).\n\nMaybe we can find a connection via common names? For example, does any person appear in both chains? We can try to trace from Amanda upwards: Amanda -> Katherine -> Anthony -> Richard. From Adam downwards: Adam -> Emma -> Randy -> Sharon -> Stephen -> Debra, etc.\n\nBut also we might have connections from other branches. \n\nAnother approach: since there are many relationships, perhaps we can build a small graph focusing on key names that might link. But there are over 100 names, so maybe we can look for statements that link known names.\n\nMaybe we can look for statements that involve both a name from Amanda's ancestry and a name from Adam's descent. \n\nAlternatively, we can try to find if Amanda and Adam have a common ancestor. That would require finding a person who is ancestor to both. That means there is a path from some person X to Amanda and from X to Adam. Since Adam is an ancestor of Emma, if there is an X that is an ancestor of Adam, then X is also ancestor of Amanda? Actually, for common ancestor, we need X such that X is ancestor of Amanda and X is ancestor of Adam. Or if X is ancestor of Amanda and X is ancestor of Adam's ancestor, but Adam himself is a person; common ancestor means a person who is an ancestor of both Amanda and Adam. So we need to find if there exists a person Y such that there is a path from Y to Amanda and from Y to Adam.\n\nSimilarly, common descendant: a person Z such that Amanda and Adam are both ancestors of Z.\n\nOption 3: Amanda is Adam's ancestor. That would require a path from Amanda to Adam. Option 4: Amanda is Adam's descendant: path from Adam to Amanda.\n\nGiven the complexity, we can try to trace from Amanda upwards and from Adam upwards to see if they meet. Or from Amanda downwards and Adam downwards to see if they meet.\n\nLet's start with Amanda's ancestors (people who are ancestors of Amanda). We have:\n- Katherine (direct ancestor)\n- Anthony (ancestor of Katherine, so ancestor of Amanda)\n- Richard (ancestor of Anthony, so ancestor of Amanda)\nAre there more? From the list, we have: \n- Richard is Anthony's ancestor. So that's it for now.\n\nAlso, maybe Anthony has other ancestors? Not given directly. But we could have: \"Richard is Anthony's ancestor.\" That's it.\n\nNow, who is Richard? Possibly Richard has ancestors? Not given. So Amanda's ancestors known: Katherine, Anthony, Richard.\n\nNow Adam's ancestors: We need to find if Adam has any ancestors given. Look for statements where Adam is a descendant: \"Adam is ... descendant?\" Not given. Adam only appears in \"Adam is Emma's ancestor.\" So Adam is not listed as a descendant of anyone. So Adam's ancestors are not specified. So it's unlikely that Amanda and Adam share a common ancestor from the given data unless one of Amanda's ancestors is also an ancestor of Adam. But we don't have any information about Adam's ancestors. So we cannot conclude they share a common ancestor from the given info (unless there is an indirect connection where Adam is a descendant of someone who is also an ancestor of Amanda? That would require Adam being in the descendant line of that common ancestor. But we don't have any ancestors of Adam. So unless Adam himself is an ancestor of Amanda? That would be option 3 or 4. Or if Adam is a descendant of Amanda? That would be option 3. So we need to check if there is a path from Adam to Amanda or from Amanda to Adam.\n\nNow check if Amanda is Adam's descendant: i.e., is there a chain from Adam to Amanda? That means Adam is an ancestor of Amanda. We have Adam -> Emma -> ... -> Amanda? So we need to connect Emma to Amanda.\n\nEmma is an ancestor of Randy. Randy is an ancestor of Sharon. Sharon is an ancestor of Stephen. Stephen is an ancestor of Debra? Actually Debra is Stephen's descendant, so Stephen -> Debra. So we have Adam -> Emma -> Randy -> Sharon -> Stephen -> Debra. Could Debra be connected to Amanda? Not directly. Debra appears also as: \"Debra is Heather's ancestor.\" and \"Debra is Stephen's descendant.\" Also \"Alice is Heather's descendant.\" and \"Alice is Cynthia's ancestor.\" etc. But no obvious link to Amanda.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Emma is connected to Katherine? Not directly.\n\nMaybe Adam is connected to Katherine through other paths? Let's look for any connection between the names in Amanda's ancestry (Katherine, Anthony, Richard) and Adam's descent (Emma, Randy, Sharon, Stephen, etc.) or between Adam and Katherine.\n\nPerhaps we can find a connection via other people. For example, maybe Katherine is connected to Emma through some chain. Let's search for Katherine in other statements: only the two we have. Anthony: also only those. Richard: \"Richard is Anthony's ancestor.\" and also \"Richard is Patricia's descendant.\" That might be helpful: \"Richard is Patricia's descendant.\" So Patricia -> Richard. So now Amanda's ancestors include Patricia as well. Also, Patricia appears in: \"Brenda is Patricia's ancestor.\" So Brenda -> Patricia. And \"Kevin is Brenda's ancestor.\" So Kevin -> Brenda. And \"Kevin is Jason's descendant.\" So Jason -> Kevin? Wait: \"Kevin is Jason's descendant.\" means Jason is ancestor of Kevin. So Jason -> Kevin -> Brenda -> Patricia -> Richard -> Anthony -> Katherine -> Amanda. So now we have a longer ancestor chain for Amanda.\n\nAlso, maybe there are other connections: \"Richard is Patricia's descendant.\" and \"Patricia\" might have other connections? Possibly.\n\nNow, what about Adam's side? Adam -> Emma. Emma -> Randy. Randy -> Sharon. Sharon -> Stephen. Stephen -> Debra. Debra -> Heather? Actually \"Debra is Heather's ancestor.\" So Debra -> Heather. Heather appears in: \"Alice is Heather's descendant.\" So Heather -> Alice. Also \"Alice is Cynthia's ancestor.\" So Alice -> Cynthia. And \"Cynthia is Raymond's ancestor.\" So Cynthia -> Raymond. And \"Raymond is Scott's ancestor.\" So Raymond -> Scott. And \"Scott is Jessica's ancestor.\" So Scott -> Jessica. And \"Jessica is Edward's ancestor.\" So Jessica -> Edward. And \"Edward is Karen's ancestor.\" So Edward -> Karen. And \"Karen\" appears in: \"Philip is Karen's descendant.\" So Karen -> Philip. And \"Judith is Philip's descendant.\" So Philip -> Judith? Actually \"Judith is Philip's descendant.\" means Philip -> Judith? Wait careful: \"Judith is Philip's descendant.\" means Philip is ancestor of Judith. So Philip -> Judith. Also \"Judith is Jean's ancestor.\" So Judith -> Jean. And \"Carolyn is Jean's descendant.\" So Jean -> Carolyn. And \"Carolyn is Albert's ancestor.\" So Carolyn -> Albert. And \"Albert is Laura's ancestor.\" So Albert -> Laura. And \"Keith is Laura's descendant.\" So Laura -> Keith. And \"Mason is Keith's descendant.\" So Keith -> Mason. And \"Mason is Helen's ancestor.\" So Mason -> Helen. And \"Helen is Sarah's ancestor.\" So Helen -> Sarah. And \"Sarah\" appears in: \"Danielle is Sarah's descendant.\" So Sarah -> Danielle. And \"Donald is Danielle's descendant.\" So Danielle -> Donald. And \"Kathryn is Donald's descendant.\" So Donald -> Kathryn. And \"Kathryn is Ethan's ancestor.\" So Kathryn -> Ethan. And \"Mary is Ethan's descendant.\" So Ethan -> Mary. And \"Mary is Natalie's ancestor.\" So Mary -> Natalie. And \"Matthew is Natalie's descendant.\" So Natalie -> Matthew. And \"Julia is Matthew's descendant.\" So Matthew -> Julia. And \"Julia is Linda's ancestor.\" So Julia -> Linda. And \"Ruth is Linda's descendant.\" So Linda -> Ruth. And \"David is Ruth's descendant.\" So Ruth -> David. And \"Ronald is David's descendant.\" So David -> Ronald. And \"Ronald is Denise's ancestor.\" So Ronald -> Denise. And \"Michael is Denise's descendant.\" So Denise -> Michael. And \"Elizabeth is Michael's descendant.\" So Michael -> Elizabeth. And \"William is Elizabeth's descendant.\" So Elizabeth -> William. And \"Alan is William's descendant.\" So William -> Alan. And \"Alan is Isabella's ancestor.\" So Alan -> Isabella. And \"Isabella is Patrick's ancestor.\" So Isabella -> Patrick. And \"Patrick is Christian's ancestor.\" So Patrick -> Christian. And \"Christian is Janice's ancestor.\" So Christian -> Janice. And \"Noah is Janice's descendant.\" So Janice -> Noah. And \"Noah is Aaron's ancestor.\" So Noah -> Aaron. And \"Emily is Aaron's descendant.\" So Aaron -> Emily. And \"Emily is Lawrence's ancestor.\" So Emily -> Lawrence. And \"Lawrence is Theresa's ancestor.\" So Lawrence -> Theresa. And \"Theresa is Marilyn's ancestor.\" So Theresa -> Marilyn. And \"Marilyn is Stephanie's ancestor.\" So Marilyn -> Stephanie. And \"Christina is Stephanie's descendant.\" So Stephanie -> Christina. And \"Samantha is Christina's descendant.\" So Christina -> Samantha. And \"Christopher is Samantha's descendant.\" So Samantha -> Christopher. And \"Daniel is Christopher's descendant.\" So Christopher -> Daniel. And \"Ryan is Daniel's descendant.\" So Daniel -> Ryan. And \"Ryan is Robert's ancestor.\" So Ryan -> Robert. And \"Robert is Zachary's ancestor.\" So Robert -> Zachary. And \"Steven is Zachary's descendant.\" So Zachary -> Steven. And \"Juan is Steven's descendant.\" So Steven -> Juan. And \"Russell is Juan's descendant.\" So Juan -> Russell. And \"Russell is Alexis's ancestor.\" So Russell -> Alexis. And \"Alexis is Wayne's ancestor.\" So Alexis -> Wayne. And \"Wayne is Kathleen's ancestor.\" So Wayne -> Kathleen. And \"Catherine is Kathleen's descendant.\" So Kathleen -> Catherine.

And \"Billy is Peter's descendant.\" So Peter -> Billy. And \"Billy is Eugene's ancestor.\" So Billy -> Eugene. And \"Eugene is Jacqueline's ancestor.\" So Eugene -> Jacqueline. And \"Jacqueline is Diana's ancestor.\" So Jacqueline -> Diana. And \"Diana is Brandon's ancestor.\" So Diana -> Brandon. And \"Kelly is Brandon's descendant.\" So Brandon -> Kelly. And \"Kelly is Terry's ancestor.\" So Kelly -> Terry. And \"Terry is Jason's ancestor.\" So Terry -> Jason. And \"Kevin is Jason's descendant.\" So Jason -> Kevin. And we already had Kevin in the chain earlier. So this is a huge cycle? Actually it seems we have a loop: we started from Adam -> Emma -> ... -> Kevin -> ... and then eventually back to Kevin? Wait, we already had Kevin earlier in Amanda's ancestor chain? Actually we had Jason -> Kevin -> Brenda -> Patricia -> Richard -> Anthony -> Katherine -> Amanda. And then from Adam's side we eventually got to Kevin again? Let's see: from Adam we went through a long chain and eventually got to Kelly -> Terry -> Jason -> Kevin. So indeed, we have reached Kevin from both sides. That means there is a connection between Adam's line and Amanda's line through Kevin? But careful: We started from Adam and went through a very long chain to reach Kevin. And from Amanda we also have an ancestor chain to Kevin. That means Kevin is a common descendant? Or common ancestor? Let's clarify.\n\nFrom Amanda's side: we traced ancestors upwards: Amanda <- Katherine <- Anthony <- Richard <- Patricia <- Brenda <- Kevin <- Jason. So Kevin is an ancestor of Amanda (since Kevin -> Brenda -> Patricia -> Richard -> Anthony -> Katherine -> Amanda). So Kevin is an ancestor of Amanda.\n\nFrom Adam's side: we traced descendants downwards: Adam -> Emma -> Randy -> Sharon -> Stephen -> Debra -> Heather -> Alice -> Cynthia -> Raymond -> Scott -> Jessica -> Edward -> Karen -> Philip -> Judith -> Jean -> Carolyn -> Albert -> Laura -> Keith -> Mason -> Helen -> Sarah -> Danielle -> Donald -> Kathryn -> Ethan -> Mary -> Natalie -> Matthew -> Julia -> Linda -> Ruth -> David -> Ronald -> Denise -> Michael -> Elizabeth -> William -> Alan -> Isabella -> Patrick -> Christian -> Janice -> Noah -> Aaron -> Emily -> Lawrence -> Theresa -> Marilyn -> Stephanie -> Christina -> Samantha -> Christopher -> Daniel -> Ryan -> Robert -> Zachary -> Steven -> Juan -> Russell -> Alexis -> Wayne -> Kathleen -> Catherine -> Kayla -> Joshua -> Amy -> Samuel -> Margaret -> Jeremy -> Bobby -> Janet -> Douglas -> Victoria -> Diane -> Gabriel -> Mark -> Justin -> Andrew -> George -> Ann -> Angela -> Teresa -> Rebecca -> Austin -> Gloria -> Larry -> Evelyn -> Willie -> Pamela -> Maria -> Bradley -> Charlotte -> Jacob -> Bruce -> Nathan -> Charles -> Frances -> Jeffrey -> Dennis -> Susan -> Jerry -> Joe -> Ralph -> Sara -> Kenneth -> Gary -> Tyler -> Henry -> Carl -> Betty -> Jose -> Timothy -> Jack -> Gerald -> Cheryl -> Doris -> Kyle -> Arthur -> Lisa -> Virginia -> Jordan -> Melissa -> Dorothy -> Christine -> Carol -> Dylan -> Joyce -> Hannah -> Shirley -> James -> John -> Jesse -> Beverly -> Roger -> Barbara -> Roy -> Bryan -> Megan -> Brian -> Grace -> Andrea -> Deborah -> Elijah -> Amber -> Anna -> Sophia -> Nancy -> Rachel -> Kimberly -> Julie -> Olivia -> Frank -> Martha -> Jonathan -> Judy -> Lori -> Sean -> Nicole -> Michelle -> Marie -> Logan -> Vincent -> Madison -> Thomas -> Joseph -> Alexander -> Brittany -> Eric -> Nicholas -> Joan -> Sandra -> Harold -> Walter -> Peter -> Billy -> Eugene -> Jacqueline -> Diana -> Brandon -> Kelly -> Terry -> Jason -> Kevin. So from Adam, we followed a long descendant path that eventually leads to Kevin. That means Kevin is a descendant of Adam? Actually careful: we started from Adam and went forward along descendant relationships. So if Adam -> Emma, and then Emma -> Randy, etc., all the way to Kevin, that means Adam is an ancestor of Kevin. So Kevin is a descendant of Adam. So we have: Adam is an ancestor of Kevin, and Kevin is an ancestor of Amanda. Therefore, Adam is an ancestor of Amanda? Not necessarily directly, but if Adam is ancestor of Kevin and Kevin is ancestor of Amanda, then Adam is ancestor of Amanda (assuming no contradictions like gender or something, but lineage is transitive). So that would imply that Amanda is Adam's descendant. That corresponds to option 4: Amanda is Adam's descendant.\n\nBut we need to check if the chain is valid. We followed a long chain from Adam to Kevin. But is that chain actually all descendant relationships? We need to ensure that each step is correctly interpreted as an ancestor-to-descendant edge in the direction we went. We started with Adam -> Emma (Adam is Emma's ancestor). Then Emma -> Randy (Emma is Randy's ancestor). Then Randy -> Sharon (Randy is Sharon's ancestor). Then Sharon -> Stephen (Sharon is Stephen's ancestor). Then Stephen -> Debra (Debra is Stephen's descendant, so Stephen -> Debra). Then Debra -> Heather (Debra is Heather's ancestor). Then Heather -> Alice (Alice is Heather's descendant, so Heather -> Alice). Then Alice -> Cynthia (Alice is Cynthia's ancestor). Then Cynthia -> Raymond (Cynthia is Raymond's ancestor). Then Raymond -> Scott (Raymond is Scott's ancestor). Then Scott -> Jessica (Scott is Jessica's ancestor). Then Jessica -> Edward (Jessica is Edward's ancestor).

Then Jason -> Kevin (Kevin is Jason's descendant, so Jason -> Kevin).\n\nSo indeed, there is a chain from Adam to Kevin. And from Kevin to Amanda, we have: Kevin -> Brenda -> Patricia -> Richard -> Anthony -> Katherine -> Amanda. So Adam -> ... -> Kevin -> ... -> Amanda. That means Adam is an ancestor of Amanda. So Amanda is Adam's descendant.\n\nBut wait, we should also check if there are any contradictory relationships that would break this chain. For example, if there is a relationship that says Kevin is not an ancestor of Amanda? But we have the chain. Also, we need to make sure that the chain does not have any loops that would invalidate the lineage (like someone being their own ancestor). But that's unlikely.\n\nWe should also consider if there is a shorter path. But the existence of one path is enough.\n\nWe also need to check if there is any other relationship that might imply a different connection. For example, could Amanda be an ancestor of Adam? That would require a path from Amanda to Adam. Possibly from Amanda downwards to Adam? That seems unlikely given we have a path from Adam to Amanda.\n\nAlso, do they share a common ancestor? Possibly, but since we already found that Adam is an ancestor of Amanda, that is a stronger relationship. If Adam is an ancestor of Amanda, then they also share common ancestors (any ancestor of Adam is also an ancestor of Amanda). But the question asks for the lineage relationship between Amanda and Adam. The options are mutually exclusive? Probably they expect the most direct relationship if it exists.\n\nGiven the chain, we can conclude Amanda is Adam's descendant. So answer should be 4.\n\nBut we should double-check that the chain is correctly constructed and there are no misinterpretations. In particular, we should verify that the step from Kevin to Amanda is indeed valid. From the list, we have:\n- Kevin is Brenda's ancestor. (from \"Kevin is Brenda's ancestor\"? Actually we have \"Kevin is Brenda's ancestor.\" Wait, we have \"Kevin is Brenda's ancestor.\" Let's check: In the list: \"Kevin is Brenda's ancestor.\" Yes, it says: \"Kevin is Brenda's ancestor.\" But earlier I said \"Kevin is Jason's descendant.\" which is also true. So Kevin has multiple relations: Kevin is both an ancestor of Brenda and a descendant of Jason. That's fine; a person can be both an ancestor and a descendant of different people. So we have Kevin -> Brenda.\n- Brenda is Patricia's ancestor. (\"Brenda is Patricia's ancestor.\") So Brenda -> Patricia.\n- Patricia is Richard's ancestor? Actually \"Richard is Patricia's descendant.\" So Patricia -> Richard.\n- Richard is Anthony's ancestor. (\"Richard is Anthony's ancestor.\") So Richard -> Anthony.\n- Anthony is Katherine's ancestor. (\"Anthony is Katherine's ancestor.\") So Anthony -> Katherine.\n- Katherine is Amanda's ancestor? Actually \"Amanda is Katherine's descendant.\" So Katherine -> Amanda.\nSo indeed Kevin -> Brenda -> Patricia -> Richard -> Anthony -> Katherine -> Amanda.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nNow the long chain from Adam to Kevin: We started with Adam -> Emma -> Randy -> Sharon -> Stephen -> Debra -> ... -> Kevin. We need to ensure each step is correctly oriented. Let's verify some critical steps:\n\n1. Adam -> Emma: \"Adam is Emma's ancestor.\" Correct.\n2.

Terry -> Jason: \"Terry is Jason's ancestor.\" Correct.\n185. Jason -> Kevin: \"Kevin is Jason's descendant.\" So Jason -> Kevin. Correct.\n\nSo every step is correctly oriented. Therefore, Adam is an ancestor of Kevin, and Kevin is an ancestor of Amanda, so by transitivity, Adam is an ancestor of Amanda. Hence, Amanda is Adam's descendant.\n\nThus the answer is 4.\n\nWe should also check if there is any possibility that Amanda is Adam's ancestor, which would be a contradiction. That would require a path from Amanda to Adam. We could try to find one, but given we already have a path from Adam to Amanda, unless there is a cycle where Adam is also a descendant of Amanda, that would be odd. But we can check if there is a statement that says Amanda is an ancestor of someone who leads to Adam. For example, if Amanda is an ancestor of Katherine? But we have Katherine as ancestor of Amanda, so that would be a cycle. But that's not given. The relationships given are likely consistent and acyclic (since they represent lineage, though there could be cycles if we misinterpret, but typically family trees are acyclic). Given the long chain we derived, it's likely that the intended relationship is that Amanda is a descendant of Adam.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option 4.\n\nNow, we should enclose the answer in the required tag."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1437,"completion_tokens":13780,"total_tokens":15217,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":13772},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":1437},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
