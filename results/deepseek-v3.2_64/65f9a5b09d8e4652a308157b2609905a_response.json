Vincent is Logan's ancestor.\n\nWe need to find connections between Billy and Arthur.\n\nLet's start by extracting all relationships that involve Billy or Arthur.\n\nFrom the list:\n- Arthur is Lisa's ancestor. (46)\n- Peter is Billy's descendant. (61) That means Billy is Peter's ancestor? Careful: \"Peter is Billy's descendant\" means Billy is Peter's ancestor. So Billy -> Peter.\n\nAlso, other relationships may connect through chains.\n\nWe need to see if there is a path from Billy to Arthur or vice versa, or if they connect through a common ancestor or descendant.\n\nLet's try to build a directed graph where an edge from X to Y means X is an ancestor of Y (or equivalently, Y is X's descendant). But note the statements are sometimes given as \"A is B's descendant\" meaning B is ancestor of A. So we need to be consistent.\n\nLet's interpret each statement as \"Ancestor -> Descendant\" form. So if \"X is Y's descendant\", then Y -> X. If \"X is Y's ancestor\", then X -> Y.\n\nLet's rewrite each statement in ancestor->descendant form:\n\n1. Rachel is Judith's descendant. => Judith -> Rachel\n2. Brandon is Roger's ancestor. => Brandon -> Roger\n3. Judith is Evelyn's descendant. => Evelyn -> Judith\n4. Jonathan is Brittany's descendant. => Brittany -> Jonathan\n5. Charlotte is Nancy's descendant. => Nancy -> Charlotte\n6. Vincent is Madison's descendant. => Madison -> Vincent\n7. Bryan is Roy's descendant. => Roy -> Bryan\n8. Eric is Nicholas's descendant. => Nicholas -> Eric\n9. Lori is Abigail's ancestor. => Lori -> Abigail\n10. Deborah is Elijah's descendant. => Elijah -> Deborah\n11. Barbara is Roy's ancestor. => Barbara -> Roy\n12. Bryan is Frances's ancestor. => Bryan -> Frances\n13. Walter is Marilyn's ancestor. => Walter -> Marilyn\n14. Carol is Hannah's descendant. => Hannah -> Carol\n15. Dorothy is Melissa's descendant. => Melissa -> Dorothy\n16. Peter is Walter's ancestor. => Peter -> Walter\n17. Nancy is Rachel's descendant. => Rachel -> Nancy\n18. Helen is Jordan's ancestor. => Helen -> Jordan\n19. Sophia is Shirley's ancestor. => Sophia -> Shirley\n20. Nicholas is Joan's descendant. => Joan -> Nicholas\n21. Jesse is John's descendant. => John -> Jesse\n22. Dylan is Teresa's ancestor. => Dylan -> Teresa\n23. Jonathan is Judy's ancestor. => Jonathan -> Judy\n24. Eric is Brenda's ancestor. => Eric -> Brenda\n25. Elijah is Marie's descendant. => Marie -> Elijah\n26. Katherine is Sean's descendant. => Sean -> Katherine\n27. Lisa is Helen's ancestor. => Lisa -> Helen\n28. Katherine is Brittany's ancestor. => Katherine -> Brittany\n29. Marilyn is Harold's ancestor. => Marilyn -> Harold\n30. Alexander is Brenda's descendant. => Brenda -> Alexander\n31. Charlotte is Andrea's ancestor. => Charlotte -> Andrea\n32. Joseph is Thomas's ancestor. => Joseph -> Thomas\n33. Sandra is Harold's descendant. => Harold -> Sandra\n34. Diane is Dorothy's descendant. => Dorothy -> Diane\n35. Hannah is Diane's descendant. => Diane -> Hannah? Wait careful: \"Hannah is Diane's descendant\" means Diane is ancestor of Hannah. So Diane -> Hannah.\n36. Abigail is Deborah's descendant. => Deborah -> Abigail\n37. Cheryl is Anna's ancestor. => Cheryl -> Anna\n38. Nicole is Sean's ancestor. => Nicole -> Sean\n39. Michelle is Nicole's ancestor. => Michelle -> Nicole\n40. Cheryl is Andrea's descendant. => Andrea -> Cheryl\n41. Sophia is Teresa's descendant. => Teresa -> Sophia\n42. Lori is Brian's descendant. => Brian -> Lori\n43. Carol is Dylan's ancestor. => Carol -> Dylan\n44. Joan is Sandra's descendant. => Sandra -> Joan\n45. Amanda is Michelle's ancestor. => Amanda -> Michelle\n46. Arthur is Lisa's ancestor. => Arthur -> Lisa\n47. James is John's ancestor. => James -> John\n48. Frank is Olivia's ancestor. => Frank -> Olivia\n49. Brian is Frances's descendant. => Frances -> Brian\n50. Brandon is Jesse's descendant. => Jesse -> Brandon\n51. Roger is Barbara's ancestor. => Roger -> Barbara\n52. Alexander is Joseph's ancestor. => Alexander -> Joseph\n53. Amanda is Logan's descendant. => Logan -> Amanda\n54. Olivia is Julie's ancestor. => Olivia -> Julie\n55. Evelyn is Kimberly's descendant. => Kimberly -> Evelyn\n56. Jordan is Melissa's ancestor. => Jordan -> Melissa\n57. Julie is Kimberly's ancestor. => Julie -> Kimberly\n58. Thomas is Madison's ancestor. => Thomas -> Madison\n59. Frank is Judy's descendant. => Judy -> Frank\n60. Anna is Marie's ancestor. => Anna -> Marie\n61. Peter is Billy's descendant. => Billy -> Peter\n62. Shirley is James's ancestor. => Shirley -> James\n63. Vincent is Logan's ancestor. => Vincent -> Logan\n\nNow we have a directed graph. We need to see if there is a path from Billy to Arthur, or Arthur to Billy, or if they share a common ancestor or common descendant.\n\nWe start with Billy. From (61): Billy -> Peter.\nThen from (16): Peter -> Walter.\nThen from (13): Walter -> Marilyn.\nThen from (29): Marilyn -> Harold.\nThen from (33): Harold -> Sandra.\nThen from (44): Sandra -> Joan.\nThen from (20): Joan -> Nicholas.\nThen from (8): Nicholas -> Eric.\nThen from (24): Eric -> Brenda.\nThen from (30): Brenda -> Alexander.\nThen from (52): Alexander -> Joseph.\nThen from (32): Joseph -> Thomas.\nThen from (58): Thomas -> Madison.\nThen from (6): Madison -> Vincent.\nThen from (63): Vincent -> Logan.\nThen from (53): Logan -> Amanda.\nThen from (45): Amanda -> Michelle.\nThen from (39): Michelle -> Nicole.\nThen from (38): Nicole -> Sean.\nThen from (26): Sean -> Katherine.\nThen from (28): Katherine -> Brittany.\nThen from (4): Brittany -> Jonathan.\nThen from (23): Jonathan -> Judy.\nThen from (59): Judy -> Frank.\nThen from (48): Frank -> Olivia.\nThen from (54): Olivia -> Julie.\nThen from (57): Julie -> Kimberly.\nThen from (55): Kimberly -> Evelyn.\nThen from (3): Evelyn -> Judith.\nThen from (1): Judith -> Rachel.\nThen from (17): Rachel -> Nancy.\nThen from (5): Nancy -> Charlotte.\nThen from (31): Charlotte -> Andrea.\nThen from (40): Andrea -> Cheryl.\nThen from (37): Cheryl -> Anna.\nThen from (60): Anna -> Marie.\nThen from (25): Marie -> Elijah.\nThen from (10): Elijah -> Deborah.\nThen from (36): Deborah -> Abigail.\nThen from (9): Lori -> Abigail? Wait, (9) says Lori is Abigail's ancestor: Lori -> Abigail. But we have Deborah -> Abigail. So Abigail has multiple ancestors? That's fine.\nThen from (42): Brian -> Lori? Actually (42) says Lori is Brian's descendant: Brian -> Lori.\nThen from (49): Frances -> Brian.\nThen from (12): Bryan -> Frances.\nThen from (7): Roy -> Bryan.\nThen from (11): Barbara -> Roy.\nThen from (51): Roger -> Barbara.\nThen from (2): Brandon -> Roger.\nThen from (50): Jesse -> Brandon.\nThen from (21): John -> Jesse.\nThen from (47): James -> John.\nThen from (62): Shirley -> James.\nThen from (19): Sophia -> Shirley.\nThen from (41): Teresa -> Sophia.\nThen from (22): Dylan -> Teresa.\nThen from (43): Carol -> Dylan.\nThen from (14): Hannah -> Carol.\nThen from (35): Diane -> Hannah? Wait (35) says Hannah is Diane's descendant: Diane -> Hannah.\nThen from (34): Dorothy -> Diane.\nThen from (15): Melissa -> Dorothy.\nThen from (56): Jordan -> Melissa.\nThen from (18): Helen -> Jordan.\nThen from (27): Lisa -> Helen.\nThen from (46): Arthur -> Lisa.\n\nSo we have a long chain from Billy all the way to Arthur? Let's see: Starting from Billy, we followed a path that eventually reaches Arthur? We went: Billy -> Peter -> Walter -> Marilyn -> Harold -> Sandra -> Joan -> Nicholas -> Eric -> Brenda -> Alexander -> Joseph -> Thomas -> Madison -> Vincent -> Logan -> Amanda -> Michelle -> Nicole -> Sean -> Katherine -> Brittany -> Jonathan -> Judy -> Frank -> Olivia -> Julie -> Kimberly -> Evelyn -> Judith -> Rachel -> Nancy -> Charlotte -> Andrea -> Cheryl -> Anna -> Marie -> Elijah -> Deborah -> Abigail -> ... Wait at Abigail, we used (9): Lori -> Abigail, but that goes from Lori to Abigail, but we were coming from Deborah to Abigail. To go from Abigail to Arthur, we need a path. From Abigail, we have two outgoing edges? Actually, Abigail is a descendant of Deborah and an ancestor of? Wait, (9) says Lori is Abigail's ancestor, so Abigail is descendant of Lori, so edge Lori -> Abigail. But we came from Deborah -> Abigail. So Abigail has incoming edges from Deborah and Lori. To continue the path, we need an outgoing edge from Abigail. Does Abigail have any outgoing edges? Not directly. But we have (36): Abigail is Deborah's descendant, that's the same. Also (9): Lori -> Abigail, so Abigail is a sink? Possibly. But we also have that Lori is Brian's descendant (42): Brian -> Lori. So if we go from Abigail backwards? We need to go forward towards Arthur. So maybe we shouldn't go from Deborah -> Abigail? Let's see if there is another path.\n\nWe went from Marie -> Elijah -> Deborah -> Abigail. Then from Abigail, we used (9) Lori -> Abigail, but that is the wrong direction: Lori is ancestor of Abigail, so Abigail is descendant of Lori. So if we want to go from Billy to Arthur, we need a directed path from Billy to Arthur. That means we need a sequence of edges such that each step goes from ancestor to descendant. So we need to go from Billy to some person, then to another, eventually to Arthur. In the chain above, we went from Billy to Peter, etc., all the way to Abigail. But from Abigail, there is no edge outgoing to continue to Arthur. So maybe we took a wrong turn somewhere. Alternatively, we might need to go from Arthur to Billy? Possibly the path is in the other direction.\n\nLet's try to go from Arthur backwards to Billy? That would be if Arthur is an ancestor of Billy, then there is a directed path from Arthur to Billy. Or if they share a common ancestor, we need to find some person X such that there are paths from X to Arthur and from X to Billy. Or common descendant: some Y such that Arthur -> ... -> Y and Billy -> ... -> Y.\n\nSo we need to explore connections.\n\nFirst, let's list all edges we have in a more manageable way. Maybe we can group or find smaller chains.\n\nLet's note that there are many interconnected relationships. Possibly we can find a path between Billy and Arthur by focusing on key people.\n\nWe know:\nArthur -> Lisa -> Helen -> Jordan -> Melissa -> Dorothy -> Diane -> Hannah -> Carol -> Dylan -> Teresa -> Sophia -> Shirley -> James -> John -> Jesse -> Brandon -> Roger -> Barbara -> Roy -> Bryan -> Frances -> Brian -> Lori -> Abigail -> Deborah -> Elijah -> Marie -> Anna -> Cheryl -> Andrea -> Charlotte -> Nancy -> Rachel -> Judith -> Evelyn -> Kimberly -> Julie -> Olivia -> Frank -> Judy -> Jonathan -> Brittany -> Katherine -> Sean -> Nicole -> Michelle -> Amanda -> Logan -> Vincent -> Madison -> Thomas -> Joseph -> Alexander -> Brenda -> Eric -> Nicholas -> Joan -> Sandra -> Harold -> Marilyn -> Walter -> Peter -> Billy.\n\nWait, that's essentially the reverse of what we did earlier? Actually, if we start from Arthur and go backwards through ancestors? But careful: To go from Arthur to Billy, we need a directed path from Arthur to Billy. That means Arthur is ancestor, Billy is descendant. So we need to find a sequence where each step is \"X is Y's ancestor\" meaning X -> Y. So we start at Arthur, and we want to reach Billy following the arrows forward.\n\nLet's start from Arthur and see if we can reach Billy.\n\nArthur -> Lisa (46)\nLisa -> Helen (27)\nHelen -> Jordan (18)\nJordan -> Melissa (56)\nMelissa -> Dorothy (15) but careful: (15) says Dorothy is Melissa's descendant, so Melissa -> Dorothy.\nDorothy -> Diane (34) Diane is Dorothy's descendant, so Dorothy -> Diane.\nDiane -> Hannah (35) Hannah is Diane's descendant, so Diane -> Hannah.\nHannah -> Carol (14) Carol is Hannah's descendant, so Hannah -> Carol.\nCarol -> Dylan (43)\nDylan -> Teresa (22)\nTeresa -> Sophia (41) Sophia is Teresa's descendant, so Teresa -> Sophia.\nSophia -> Shirley (19)\nShirley -> James (62)\nJames -> John (47)\nJohn -> Jesse (21) Jesse is John's descendant, so John -> Jesse.\nJesse -> Brandon (50) Brandon is Jesse's descendant, so Jesse -> Brandon.\nBrandon -> Roger (2)\nRoger -> Barbara (51)\nBarbara -> Roy (11)\nRoy -> Bryan (7) Bryan is Roy's descendant, so Roy -> Bryan.\nBryan -> Frances (12)\nFrances -> Brian (49) Brian is Frances's descendant, so Frances -> Brian.\nBrian -> Lori (42) Lori is Brian's descendant, so Brian -> Lori.\nLori -> Abigail (9)\nAbigail -> Deborah (36) Deborah is Abigail's ancestor? Wait: (36) says Abigail is Deborah's descendant, so Deborah -> Abigail. That is the opposite direction: Abigail is descendant of Deborah, so Deborah is ancestor of Abigail. So from Abigail, we have an incoming edge from Deborah, not outgoing. So we cannot go from Abigail to Deborah following ancestor->descendant. So at Abigail, we are stuck if we want to continue forward. So maybe we need to go a different route from Lori? Or maybe we took a wrong turn earlier.\n\nWe went from Brian -> Lori -> Abigail. From Abigail, there is no outgoing edge. So perhaps we should not go from Lori to Abigail? But that is the only edge from Lori. So maybe from Brian, there is another path? Brian only has outgoing to Lori? Actually, from Brian, we have only (42): Brian -> Lori. So that's it.\n\nSo from Arthur, following the arrows forward, we get to Lori -> Abigail and then stop. So we cannot reach Billy from Arthur along that path.\n\nNow, can we go from Billy to Arthur? We already attempted that earlier and got stuck at Abigail. So maybe there is another route.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider other connections. Possibly there is a common ancestor or common descendant.\n\nLet's try to find ancestors of Billy and ancestors of Arthur, and see if they intersect.\n\nAncestors of Billy: anyone who is an ancestor of Billy. That means any X such that there is a path X -> ... -> Billy.\nFrom (61): Peter is Billy's descendant, so Billy -> Peter, that means Billy is ancestor of Peter, not the other way. Actually careful: \"Peter is Billy's descendant\" means Billy is ancestor of Peter. So Billy -> Peter. So Peter is a descendant of Billy. So ancestors of Billy are not given directly. We have to look for statements where Billy is a descendant. The only one is (61): Peter is Billy's descendant. That gives Billy -> Peter. So to find ancestors of Billy, we need statements where Billy appears on the right side of an arrow. There is none. So Billy has no listed ancestors? Possibly Billy is a root in the graph (no incoming edges). But we can also infer ancestors if there are chains leading to Billy. For example, if X -> Y and Y -> Billy, then X is ancestor. But we need a statement that says someone is Billy's ancestor or Billy is someone's descendant. Only (61) mentions Billy, and it says Peter is Billy's descendant, so Billy is Peter's ancestor. So we know Billy is an ancestor of Peter, but we don't know who Billy's ancestors are. So Billy might be a source.\n\nSimilarly, for Arthur, we have (46): Arthur is Lisa's ancestor, so Arthur -> Lisa. Also, (46) gives Arthur as ancestor. To find ancestors of Arthur, we need statements where Arthur is a descendant. There is none. So Arthur might also be a source.\n\nThus, both Billy and Arthur might be roots. If they are both roots, they might not have a common ancestor unless they are the same person, but they are different names. So they might not share a common ancestor. But wait, we need to check if there are any indirect connections. Possibly there is some chain that connects them through a common descendant? That is, if there is some person Z such that Billy -> ... -> Z and Arthur -> ... -> Z.\n\nSo we need to find if Billy and Arthur have a common descendant.\n\nTo find descendants of Billy: we have Billy -> Peter. Then from Peter, we can follow arrows forward. Let's list all descendants of Billy by traversing forward from Billy.\n\nStart: Billy -> Peter.\nFrom Peter: Peter -> Walter (16)\nWalter -> Marilyn (13)\nMarilyn -> Harold (29)\nHarold -> Sandra (33)\nSandra -> Joan (44)\nJoan -> Nicholas (20)\nNicholas -> Eric (8)\nEric -> Brenda (24)\nBrenda -> Alexander (30)\nAlexander -> Joseph (52)\nJoseph -> Thomas (32)\nThomas -> Madison (58)\nMadison -> Vincent (6)\nVincent -> Logan (63)\nLogan -> Amanda (53)\nAmanda -> Michelle (45)\nMichelle -> Nicole (39)\nNicole -> Sean (38)\nSean -> Katherine (26)\nKatherine -> Brittany (28)\nBrittany -> Jonathan (4)\nJonathan -> Judy (23)\nJudy -> Frank (59)\nFrank -> Olivia (48)\nOlivia -> Julie (54)\nJulie -> Kimberly (57)\nKimberly -> Evelyn (55)\nEvelyn -> Judith (3)\nJudith -> Rachel (1)\nRachel -> Nancy (17)\nNancy -> Charlotte (5)\nCharlotte -> Andrea (31)\nAndrea -> Cheryl (40)\nCheryl -> Anna (37)\nAnna -> Marie (60)\nMarie -> Elijah (25)\nElijah -> Deborah (10)\nDeborah -> Abigail (36)\n\nNow from Abigail, we have an outgoing edge? We already saw Abigail is a descendant, but does Abigail have any descendants? Look at statements: (9) says Lori is Abigail's ancestor, so that gives Lori -> Abigail, so Abigail is descendant of Lori, not ancestor. So Abigail has no listed descendants. So the chain ends at Abigail. However, note that there is also (36): Abigail is Deborah's descendant, which we used. So Abigail is a leaf.\n\nBut maybe there are other branches from earlier points. For example, from Harold, there is also (33): Harold -> Sandra, we used that. Are there other descendants of Harold? Not listed. Similarly, from Sandra, we have (44): Sandra -> Joan, used. Also, from Joan, we have (20): Joan -> Nicholas, used. So it seems we have a long linear chain from Billy to Abigail.\n\nNow, what about descendants of Arthur? Start: Arthur -> Lisa.\nLisa -> Helen (27)\nHelen -> Jordan (18)\nJordan -> Melissa (56)\nMelissa -> Dorothy (15)\nDorothy -> Diane (34)\nDiane -> Hannah (35)\nHannah -> Carol (14)\nCarol -> Dylan (43)\nDylan -> Teresa (22)\nTeresa -> Sophia (41)\nSophia -> Shirley (19)\nShirley -> James (62)\nJames -> John (47)\nJohn -> Jesse (21)\nJesse -> Brandon (50)\nBrandon -> Roger (2)\nRoger -> Barbara (51)\nBarbara -> Roy (11)\nRoy -> Bryan (7)\nBryan -> Frances (12)\nFrances -> Brian (49)\nBrian -> Lori (42)\nLori -> Abigail (9)\n\nSo Arthur's descendants also go to Abigail. So both Billy and Arthur have a descendant chain that leads to Abigail. That means Abigail is a common descendant of both Billy and Arthur. Let's verify if the chains are valid and if there is any contradiction.\n\nFrom Billy: Billy -> Peter -> Walter -> Marilyn -> Harold -> Sandra -> Joan -> Nicholas -> Eric -> Brenda -> Alexander -> Joseph -> Thomas -> Madison -> Vincent -> Logan -> Amanda -> Michelle -> Nicole -> Sean -> Katherine -> Brittany -> Jonathan -> Judy -> Frank -> Olivia -> Julie -> Kimberly -> Evelyn -> Judith -> Rachel -> Nancy -> Charlotte -> Andrea -> Cheryl -> Anna -> Marie -> Elijah -> Deborah -> Abigail.\n\nFrom Arthur: Arthur -> Lisa -> Helen -> Jordan -> Melissa -> Dorothy -> Diane -> Hannah -> Carol -> Dylan -> Teresa -> Sophia -> Shirley -> James -> John -> Jesse -> Brandon -> Roger -> Barbara -> Roy -> Bryan -> Frances -> Brian -> Lori -> Abigail.\n\nSo indeed, both chains end at Abigail. So Abigail is a descendant of both Billy and Arthur.\n\nBut we must ensure there are no inconsistencies in the chains. For example, are there any cycles? Possibly not. Also, are there any statements that contradict the direction? All steps are derived from the given statements.\n\nThus, Billy and Arthur share a common descendant: Abigail.\n\nNow, check the options:\n1. Billy and Arthur share a common ancestor.\n2. Billy is Arthur's ancestor.\n3. Billy and Arthur share a common descendant.\n4. Billy is Arthur's descendant.\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nOption 3 says they share a common descendant. That matches our finding.\n\nBut we should double-check if there is any direct ancestor-descendant relationship between them. Could Billy be an ancestor of Arthur or vice versa? We attempted to find a path from Billy to Arthur or Arthur to Billy, and we got stuck. So they are not directly in a lineage relationship. They share a common descendant.\n\nIs there any possibility that they share a common ancestor? Since both appear to be roots (no listed ancestors), it's possible they don't share a common ancestor. But we haven't proven that they don't. However, the question asks to determine the relationship from the given options. Since we found a common descendant, option 3 is correct.\n\nWe should also check if there is any other common descendant besides Abigail. Possibly there are others, but at least Abigail is one.\n\nThus, the answer should be 3.\n\nBut wait, we need to be careful: Is Abigail indeed a descendant of both? Let's verify the chains step by step.\n\nFor Billy to Abigail:\nWe need to ensure each step is valid.\n\n1. Billy -> Peter: from (61) Peter is Billy's descendant. So Billy is ancestor of Peter.\n2. Peter -> Walter: from (16) Peter is Walter's ancestor.\n3. Walter -> Marilyn: from (13) Walter is Marilyn's ancestor.\n4. Marilyn -> Harold: from (29) Marilyn is Harold's ancestor.\n5. Harold -> Sandra: from (33) Sandra is Harold's descendant, so Harold is ancestor of Sandra.\n6. Sandra -> Joan: from (44) Joan is Sandra's descendant, so Sandra is ancestor of Joan.\n7. Joan -> Nicholas: from (20) Nicholas is Joan's descendant, so Joan is ancestor of Nicholas.\n8. Nicholas -> Eric: from (8) Eric is Nicholas's descendant, so Nicholas is ancestor of Eric.\n9. Eric -> Brenda: from (24) Eric is Brenda's ancestor.\n10. Brenda -> Alexander: from (30) Alexander is Brenda's descendant, so Brenda is ancestor of Alexander.\n11. Alexander -> Joseph: from (52) Alexander is Joseph's ancestor.\n12. Joseph -> Thomas: from (32) Joseph is Thomas's ancestor.\n13. Thomas -> Madison: from (58) Thomas is Madison's ancestor.\n14. Madison -> Vincent: from (6) Vincent is Madison's descendant, so Madison is ancestor of Vincent.\n15. Vincent -> Logan: from (63) Vincent is Logan's ancestor.\n16. Logan -> Amanda: from (53) Amanda is Logan's descendant, so Logan is ancestor of Amanda.\n17. Amanda -> Michelle: from (45) Amanda is Michelle's ancestor.\n18. Michelle -> Nicole: from (39) Michelle is Nicole's ancestor.\n19. Nicole -> Sean: from (38) Nicole is Sean's ancestor.\n20. Sean -> Katherine: from (26) Katherine is Sean's descendant, so Sean is ancestor of Katherine.\n21. Katherine -> Brittany: from (28) Katherine is Brittany's ancestor.\n22. Brittany -> Jonathan: from (4) Jonathan is Brittany's descendant, so Brittany is ancestor of Jonathan.\n23. Jonathan -> Judy: from (23) Jonathan is Judy's ancestor.\n24. Judy -> Frank: from (59) Frank is Judy's descendant, so Judy is ancestor of Frank.\n25. Frank -> Olivia: from (48) Frank is Olivia's ancestor.\n26. Olivia -> Julie: from (54) Olivia is Julie's ancestor.\n27. Julie -> Kimberly: from (57) Julie is Kimberly's ancestor.\n28. Kimberly -> Evelyn: from (55) Evelyn is Kimberly's descendant, so Kimberly is ancestor of Evelyn.\n29. Evelyn -> Judith: from (3) Judith is Evelyn's descendant, so Evelyn is ancestor of Judith.\n30. Judith -> Rachel: from (1) Rachel is Judith's descendant, so Judith is ancestor of Rachel.\n31. Rachel -> Nancy: from (17) Nancy is Rachel's descendant, so Rachel is ancestor of Nancy.\n32. Nancy -> Charlotte: from (5) Charlotte is Nancy's descendant, so Nancy is ancestor of Charlotte.\n33. Charlotte -> Andrea: from (31) Charlotte is Andrea's ancestor.\n34. Andrea -> Cheryl: from (40) Cheryl is Andrea's descendant, so Andrea is ancestor of Cheryl.\n35. Cheryl -> Anna: from (37) Cheryl is Anna's ancestor.\n36. Anna -> Marie: from (60) Anna is Marie's ancestor.\n37. Marie -> Elijah: from (25) Elijah is Marie's descendant, so Marie is ancestor of Elijah.\n38. Elijah -> Deborah: from (10) Deborah is Elijah's descendant, so Elijah is ancestor of Deborah.\n39. Deborah -> Abigail: from (36) Abigail is Deborah's descendant, so Deborah is ancestor of Abigail.\n\nSo that chain is valid.\n\nNow for Arthur to Abigail:\n1. Arthur -> Lisa: from (46) Arthur is Lisa's ancestor.\n2. Lisa -> Helen: from (27) Lisa is Helen's ancestor.\n3. Helen -> Jordan: from (18) Helen is Jordan's ancestor.\n4. Jordan -> Melissa: from (56) Jordan is Melissa's ancestor.\n5. Melissa -> Dorothy: from (15) Dorothy is Melissa's descendant, so Melissa is ancestor of Dorothy.\n6. Dorothy -> Diane: from (34) Diane is Dorothy's descendant, so Dorothy is ancestor of Diane.\n7. Diane -> Hannah: from (35) Hannah is Diane's descendant, so Diane is ancestor of Hannah.\n8. Hannah -> Carol: from (14) Carol is Hannah's descendant, so Hannah is ancestor of Carol.\n9. Carol -> Dylan: from (43) Carol is Dylan's ancestor.\n10. Dylan -> Teresa: from (22) Dylan is Teresa's ancestor.\n11. Teresa -> Sophia: from (41) Sophia is Teresa's descendant, so Teresa is ancestor of Sophia.\n12. Sophia -> Shirley: from (19) Sophia is Shirley's ancestor.\n13. Shirley -> James: from (62) Shirley is James's ancestor.\n14. James -> John: from (47) James is John's ancestor.\n15. John -> Jesse: from (21) Jesse is John's descendant, so John is ancestor of Jesse.\n16. Jesse -> Brandon: from (50) Brandon is Jesse's descendant, so Jesse is ancestor of Brandon.\n17. Brandon -> Roger: from (2) Brandon is Roger's ancestor.\n18. Roger -> Barbara: from (51) Roger is Barbara's ancestor.\n19. Barbara -> Roy: from (11) Barbara is Roy's ancestor.\n20.
