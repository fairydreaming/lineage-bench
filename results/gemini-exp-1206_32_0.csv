**2. Tracing Debra's lineage upwards:**

*   Debra is Diana's descendant.
*   Diana is Jerry's descendant.
*   Jerry is Jonathan's descendant.

**3. Connecting the lineages:**

*   We don't have a direct link between Julie (from Amy's lineage) and Charlotte (from Debra's lineage).
*   However, we know that Jonathan is Jerry's ancestor and Jonathan is Charlotte's descendant. This means Jerry is an ancestor of Charlotte.
*   We also know that Vincent is John's ancestor and Charlotte is John's descendant. This means Vincent is an ancestor of Charlotte.
*   Vincent is Anthony's descendant and Kelly is Anthony's ancestor. This means Kelly is an ancestor of Vincent.
*   Kelly is Ashley's descendant and Ashley is Bruce's descendant. This means Bruce is a descendant of Kelly.
*   Bruce is Natalie's descendant and Natalie is Doris's descendant. This means Doris is an ancestor of Bruce.
*   Dylan is Doris's ancestor and Dorothy is Dylan's ancestor. This means Dorothy is an ancestor of Doris.
*   Gregory is Helen's descendant and Gregory is Dorothy's ancestor. This means Helen is a descendant of Dorothy.
*   Patrick is Helen's ancestor and Patrick is Megan's descendant. This means Megan is an ancestor of Helen.
*   Sophia is Megan's ancestor and Pamela is Sophia's ancestor. This means Pamela is an ancestor of Megan.
*   Pamela is Judith's descendant and Stephanie is Judith's ancestor. This means Stephanie is an ancestor of Pamela.
*   Jack is Stephanie's ancestor and Jack is Sarah's descendant. This means Sarah is a descendant of Stephanie.
*   Philip is Sarah's ancestor and Maria is Philip's ancestor. This means Maria is an ancestor of Sarah.
*   Stephen is Maria's ancestor and Stephen is Julie's descendant. This means Julie is an ancestor of Maria.

Since Julie is an ancestor of Maria, and Maria is an ancestor of Sarah, and Sarah is a descendant of Stephanie, and Stephanie is an ancestor of Pamela, and Pamela is an ancestor of Megan, and Megan is an ancestor of Helen, and Helen is a descendant of Dorothy, and Dorothy is an ancestor of Doris, and Doris is an ancestor of Bruce, and Bruce is a descendant of Ashley, and Ashley is a descendant of Kelly, and Kelly is an ancestor of Vincent, and Vincent is an ancestor of John, and John is an ancestor of Charlotte, and Charlotte is an ancestor of Jonathan, and Jonathan is an ancestor of Jerry, and Jerry is an ancestor of Diana, and Diana is an ancestor of Debra, then Julie is an ancestor of Debra.

Since Eugene is Jessica's ancestor, and Jessica is Julie's ancestor, then Eugene is an ancestor of Julie.
