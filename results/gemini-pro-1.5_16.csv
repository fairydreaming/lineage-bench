**Gary's Lineage:**

* Charles -> Gary -> Alan -> George -> Nicholas

**Alexander's Lineage:**

* Alexander -> Matthew -> Donna
* Alexander -> Janet -> Lisa

**Combining Information:**

We know Lisa is a descendant of both Joseph's line (through Amber) and Alexander's line.  This connects the two lineages.

We also know that Bradley is Joseph's ancestor and Ann is Bradley's ancestor.  Therefore, Ann is an ancestor in the Joseph lineage.

Nicholas is a descendant in the Gary lineage, which connects to the Joseph lineage through Lisa.

Since Ann is an ancestor in the Joseph lineage and Nicholas is a descendant branching off that same lineage (through the Alexander/Lisa connection), Nicholas is a descendant of Ann.

We can see Andrew is a common ancestor of both Megan and Judy.  Judy is an ancestor of Andrew. This creates a loop, meaning Judy and Andrew are the same person.  Therefore, Lori is also the same person.  Jose being a descendant of Stephen and an ancestor of Lori means Jose and Lori are the same person.  This collapses much of the tree.

Simplified, we have:

* Andrew -> Alice -> Debra -> Megan
* Andrew = Judy = Lori = Jose
* Nicole -> Ethan -> Juan -> Stephen -> Jose = Andrew

16. **Combining 14 and 15:** S -> Ro -> Do -> R -> B -> A -> P -> E -> D -> T (Susan is Teresa's ancestor)

Since Patrick is an ancestor of both Teresa and Eric, and Helen is a descendant of Matthew, we don't have a direct lineage connection between Teresa and Matthew through this path.  Let's explore other connections:

* **Noah is Adam's descendant:** A -> N
* **Noah is Jesse's ancestor:** N -> J
* **Rebecca is Jesse's descendant:** J -> Re
* **Susan is Rebecca's descendant:** Re -> S

Combining these: A -> N -> J -> Re -> S (Adam is Susan's ancestor)

Since Susan is an ancestor of Teresa (from step 16), and Adam is an ancestor of Susan, Adam is also an ancestor of Teresa.  However, this doesn't connect us to Matthew.

The key connection is Helen.  We know Helen is Matthew's descendant (H -> M) and Helen is Adam's ancestor (H -> A).  Therefore, H -> A and H -> M.  This means Adam and Matthew share the common ancestor Helen.

Since Adam is an ancestor of Susan, and Susan is an ancestor of Teresa, Adam is also an ancestor of Teresa.  Therefore, both Teresa and Matthew share the common ancestor Helen.
