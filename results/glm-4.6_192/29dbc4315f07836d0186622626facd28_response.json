statements:\n\n- \"Virginia is Christian's descendant.\" So Christian is an ancestor of Virginia.\n\n- \"Katherine is Alexis's ancestor.\" So Katherine is an ancestor of Alexis.\n\nThus we have Christian is an ancestor of Virginia. Katherine is an ancestor of Alexis.\n\nWe need to see if there's any path linking Christian and Alexis. Possibly through a common ancestor/descendant.\n\nWe need to find if there is any path connecting Christian to Alexis via ancestor/descendant relations.\n\nWe can treat the graph where edges are ancestor->descendant direction.\n\nDefine directed edge A -> D (A ancestor of D) if we have statement \"A is D's ancestor\" OR \"D is A's descendant\". So both statements give same direction.\n\nThus we have many edges.\n\nGoal: Determine relationship between Alexis and Christian. Options:\n\n1. Alexis is Christian's descendant. (i.e., Christian ancestor of Alexis)\n2. Alexis and Christian share a common descendant.\n3. Alexis is Christian's ancestor. (i.e., Alexis ancestor of Christian)\n4. Alexis and Christian share a common ancestor.\n5. None.\n\nThus we need to check if any directed path exists from Christian to Alexis (descendant) or from Alexis to Christian (ancestor). If not, but there is some node X such that both have directed paths to X (i.e., X is a descendant of both) => share common descendant. Or some node Y such that both have directed paths from Y (i.e., Y is ancestor of both) => share common ancestor. If none of these, answer 5.\n\nThus we need to compute connectivity.\n\nGiven the large dataset, but we can try to manually construct relevant subgraph.\n\nFirst, find ancestors of Alexis: We have Katherine is Alexis's ancestor. Also possibly other ancestors of Katherine, etc.\n\nFind ancestors of Christian: We have Virginia is Christian's descendant. So Christian is ancestor of Virginia. Also possibly other ancestors of Christian.\n\nThus Christian's ancestors are unknown (maybe none given). Christian's descendants: we have Virginia is descendant. Also maybe other descendants of Virginia.\n\nThus we need to see if any path from Christian to Alexis (descendant) or from Alexis to Christian (ancestor). Or if they share a descendant: find any node that is descendant of both. That would require a node that is descendant of Christian and also descendant of Alexis. Since we know Christian's descendant set includes Virginia and perhaps further down. Alexis's descendant set unknown; we need to see if there are any statements where Alexis is ancestor of someone (i.e., Alexis is X's ancestor). I don't recall any statements like \"Alexis is ... ancestor\". Not in the list. Only statements about Alexis: \"Katherine is Alexis's ancestor\". That's it. So Alexis may not have any known descendants (except possibly through other connections). But we can check if any statements indicate Alexis as ancestor of someone. I don't see any. So Alexis's descendant set may be empty (given data). So they cannot share a common descendant unless there is some node that is descendant of both via unknown paths. But we can't assume unknown data.\n\nSimilarly, they could share a common ancestor: find some node that is ancestor of both. We have Katherine is ancestor of Alexis. So Katherine is an ancestor of Alexis. Is Katherine also ancestor of Christian? Not directly given. But maybe Christian's ancestors include Katherine via some chain. Let's see.\n\nWe need to find ancestors of Christian: we have Christian is ancestor of Virginia. So Christian's ancestors may be unknown. But we can try to see if any statements list someone as Christian's ancestor. I don't recall any. So we have no known ancestors for Christian besides possibly unknown.\n\nThus they might share a common ancestor if there is some node Y such that Y is ancestor of both Alexis and Christian. We have Katherine is ancestor of Alexis. If Katherine is also ancestor of Christian, then they'd share common ancestor. But we have no direct statement. However, there may be other ancestors of Alexis besides Katherine, like maybe Katherine's ancestors. If any of those also are ancestors of Christian, they'd share.\n\nThus we need to find ancestors of Katherine. Let's see if there are statements about Katherine's ancestors or descendants.\n\nList statements with Katherine:\n\n- Katherine is Alexis's ancestor.\n- Katherine is Kimberly's descendant.\n\nThus Katherine is descendant of Kimberly. Wait: \"Katherine is Kimberly's descendant.\" That means Kimberly is ancestor of Katherine. So we have Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis. So Kimberly is ancestor of Alexis as well.\n\nThus Alexis's ancestors include Kimberly and Katherine.\n\nNow we need to see if Kimberly or any of its ancestors are also ancestors of Christian.\n\nCheck statements about Kimberly:\n\n- Katherine is Kimberly's descendant (already considered).\n- Madison is Kimberly's ancestor.\n\nThus Madison is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nThus Alexis's ancestors also include Madison (since Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis). Also maybe Madison's ancestors.\n\nNow check statements about Madison:\n\n- Timothy is Madison's ancestor.\n- Madison is Kimberly's ancestor.\n\nThus we have Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nThus Timothy is ancestor of Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Timothy:\n\n- Timothy is Gloria's descendant.\n- Timothy is Madison's ancestor.\n\nThus Gloria is ancestor of Timothy? Wait \"Timothy is Gloria's descendant\" means Gloria is ancestor of Timothy. So Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nThus Gloria is ancestor of Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Gloria:\n\n- Gloria is Willie's descendant.\n\nThus Willie is ancestor of Gloria. So Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nThus Willie is ancestor of Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Willie:\n\n- Willie is Angela's descendant.\n\nThus Angela is ancestor of Willie. So Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nThus Angela is ancestor of Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Angela:\n\n- Terry is Angela's ancestor.\n\nThus Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Terry:\n\n- Steven is Terry's ancestor.\n\nThus Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Steven:\n\n- Steven is Roy's descendant.\n\nThus Roy is ancestor of Steven. So Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Roy:\n\n- Karen is Roy's ancestor.\n\nThus Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Karen:\n\n- Karen is Hannah's descendant.\n\nThus Hannah is ancestor of Karen. So Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Hannah:\n\n- Richard is Hannah's ancestor.\n\nThus Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Richard:\n\n- Richard is Samantha's descendant.\n\nThus Samantha is ancestor of Richard. So Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Samantha:\n\n- Nicholas is Samantha's ancestor.\n\nThus Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Nicholas:\n\n- Nicholas is Doris's descendant.\n\nThus Doris is ancestor of Nicholas. So Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Doris:\n\n- Doris is Peter's descendant.\n\nThus Peter is ancestor of Doris.

statements:\n\n- \"Virginia is Christian's descendant.\" So Christian is an ancestor of Virginia.\n\n- \"Katherine is Alexis's ancestor.\" So Katherine is an ancestor of Alexis.\n\nThus we have Christian is an ancestor of Virginia. Katherine is an ancestor of Alexis.\n\nWe need to see if there's any path linking Christian and Alexis. Possibly through a common ancestor/descendant.\n\nWe need to find if there is any path connecting Christian to Alexis via ancestor/descendant relations.\n\nWe can treat the graph where edges are ancestor->descendant direction.\n\nDefine directed edge A -> D (A ancestor of D) if we have statement \"A is D's ancestor\" OR \"D is A's descendant\". So both statements give same direction.\n\nThus we have many edges.\n\nGoal: Determine relationship between Alexis and Christian. Options:\n\n1. Alexis is Christian's descendant. (i.e., Christian ancestor of Alexis)\n2. Alexis and Christian share a common descendant.\n3. Alexis is Christian's ancestor. (i.e., Alexis ancestor of Christian)\n4. Alexis and Christian share a common ancestor.\n5. None.\n\nThus we need to check if any directed path exists from Christian to Alexis (descendant) or from Alexis to Christian (ancestor). If not, but there is some node X such that both have directed paths to X (i.e., X is a descendant of both) => share common descendant. Or some node Y such that both have directed paths from Y (i.e., Y is ancestor of both) => share common ancestor. If none of these, answer 5.\n\nThus we need to compute connectivity.\n\nGiven the large dataset, but we can try to manually construct relevant subgraph.\n\nFirst, find ancestors of Alexis: We have Katherine is Alexis's ancestor. Also possibly other ancestors of Katherine, etc.\n\nFind ancestors of Christian: We have Virginia is Christian's descendant. So Christian is ancestor of Virginia. Also possibly other ancestors of Christian.\n\nThus Christian's ancestors are unknown (maybe none given). Christian's descendants: we have Virginia is descendant. Also maybe other descendants of Virginia.\n\nThus we need to see if any path from Christian to Alexis (descendant) or from Alexis to Christian (ancestor). Or if they share a descendant: find any node that is descendant of both. That would require a node that is descendant of Christian and also descendant of Alexis. Since we know Christian's descendant set includes Virginia and perhaps further down. Alexis's descendant set unknown; we need to see if there are any statements where Alexis is ancestor of someone (i.e., Alexis is X's ancestor). I don't recall any statements like \"Alexis is ... ancestor\". Not in the list. Only statements about Alexis: \"Katherine is Alexis's ancestor\". That's it. So Alexis may not have any known descendants (except possibly through other connections). But we can check if any statements indicate Alexis as ancestor of someone. I don't see any. So Alexis's descendant set may be empty (given data). So they cannot share a common descendant unless there is some node that is descendant of both via unknown paths. But we can't assume unknown data.\n\nSimilarly, they could share a common ancestor: find some node that is ancestor of both. We have Katherine is ancestor of Alexis. So Katherine is an ancestor of Alexis. Is Katherine also ancestor of Christian? Not directly given. But maybe Christian's ancestors include Katherine via some chain. Let's see.\n\nWe need to find ancestors of Christian: we have Christian is ancestor of Virginia. So Christian's ancestors may be unknown. But we can try to see if any statements list someone as Christian's ancestor. I don't recall any. So we have no known ancestors for Christian besides possibly unknown.\n\nThus they might share a common ancestor if there is some node Y such that Y is ancestor of both Alexis and Christian. We have Katherine is ancestor of Alexis. If Katherine is also ancestor of Christian, then they'd share common ancestor. But we have no direct statement. However, there may be other ancestors of Alexis besides Katherine, like maybe Katherine's ancestors. If any of those also are ancestors of Christian, they'd share.\n\nThus we need to find ancestors of Katherine. Let's see if there are statements about Katherine's ancestors or descendants.\n\nList statements with Katherine:\n\n- Katherine is Alexis's ancestor.\n- Katherine is Kimberly's descendant.\n\nThus Katherine is descendant of Kimberly. Wait: \"Katherine is Kimberly's descendant.\" That means Kimberly is ancestor of Katherine. So we have Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis. So Kimberly is ancestor of Alexis as well.\n\nThus Alexis's ancestors include Kimberly and Katherine.\n\nNow we need to see if Kimberly or any of its ancestors are also ancestors of Christian.\n\nCheck statements about Kimberly:\n\n- Katherine is Kimberly's descendant (already considered).\n- Madison is Kimberly's ancestor.\n\nThus Madison is ancestor of Kimberly.\n\nThus Alexis's ancestors also include Madison (since Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis). Also maybe Madison's ancestors.\n\nNow check statements about Madison:\n\n- Timothy is Madison's ancestor.\n- Madison is Kimberly's ancestor.\n\nThus we have Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nThus Timothy is ancestor of Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Timothy:\n\n- Timothy is Gloria's descendant.\n- Timothy is Madison's ancestor.\n\nThus Gloria is ancestor of Timothy? Wait \"Timothy is Gloria's descendant\" means Gloria is ancestor of Timothy. So Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nThus Gloria is ancestor of Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Gloria:\n\n- Gloria is Willie's descendant.\n\nThus Willie is ancestor of Gloria. So Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nThus Willie is ancestor of Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Willie:\n\n- Willie is Angela's descendant.\n\nThus Angela is ancestor of Willie. So Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nThus Angela is ancestor of Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Angela:\n\n- Terry is Angela's ancestor.\n\nThus Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Terry:\n\n- Steven is Terry's ancestor.\n\nThus Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Steven:\n\n- Steven is Roy's descendant.\n\nThus Roy is ancestor of Steven. So Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Roy:\n\n- Karen is Roy's ancestor.\n\nThus Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Karen:\n\n- Karen is Hannah's descendant.\n\nThus Hannah is ancestor of Karen. So Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Hannah:\n\n- Richard is Hannah's ancestor.\n\nThus Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Richard:\n\n- Richard is Samantha's descendant.\n\nThus Samantha is ancestor of Richard. So Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Samantha:\n\n- Nicholas is Samantha's ancestor.\n\nThus Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Nicholas:\n\n- Nicholas is Doris's descendant.\n\nThus Doris is ancestor of Nicholas. So Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Doris:\n\n- Doris is Peter's descendant.\n\nThus Peter is ancestor of Doris. So Peter -> Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Peter:\n\n- Emily is Peter's ancestor.\n\nThus Emily -> Peter -> Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Emily:\n\n- Emily is Jeffrey's descendant.\n\nThus Jeffrey is ancestor of Emily. So Jeffrey -> Emily -> Peter -> Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Jeffrey:\n\n- Jacob is Jeffrey's ancestor.\n\nThus Jacob -> Jeffrey -> Emily -> Peter -> Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Jacob:\n\n- Lori is Jacob's ancestor.\n\nThus Lori -> Jacob -> Jeffrey -> Emily -> Peter -> Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Lori:\n\n- Lawrence is Lori's ancestor.\n\nThus Lawrence -> Lori -> Jacob -> Jeffrey -> Emily -> Peter -> Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Lawrence:\n\n- Grace is Lawrence's ancestor.\n\nThus Grace -> Lawrence -> Lori -> Jacob -> Jeffrey -> Emily -> Peter -> Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Grace:\n\n- Grace is Elijah's descendant.\n\nThus Elijah is ancestor of Grace. So Elijah -> Grace -> Lawrence -> Lori -> Jacob -> Jeffrey -> Emily -> Peter -> Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Elijah:\n\n- Bryan is Elijah's ancestor.\n\nThus Bryan -> Elijah -> Grace -> Lawrence -> Lori -> Jacob -> Jeffrey -> Emily -> Peter -> Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Bryan:\n\n- Ashley is Bryan's ancestor.\n\nThus Ashley -> Bryan -> Elijah -> Grace -> Lawrence -> Lori -> Jacob -> Jeffrey -> Emily -> Peter -> Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Ashley:\n\n- Nancy is Ashley's ancestor.\n\nThus Nancy -> Ashley -> Bryan -> Elijah -> Grace -> Lawrence -> Lori -> Jacob -> Jeffrey -> Emily -> Peter -> Doris -> Nicholas -> Samantha -> Richard -> Hannah -> Karen -> Roy -> Steven -> Terry -> Angela -> Willie -> Gloria -> Timothy -> Madison -> Kimberly -> Katherine -> Alexis.\n\nNow check statements about Nancy:\n\n- Nancy is Christine's descendant.\n\nThus Christine is ancestor of Nancy.
