**Ashley:** \"Ashley is Kayla's ancestor.\" -> Kayla is Ashley's descendant.\n*   So, Janet -> ... -> Jean -> Ashley -> Kayla.\n\n*   **Kayla:** \"Anna is Kayla's descendant.\" -> Anna is Kayla's

starting from Janet. Janet is the ancestor of a huge number of people.\n\nNow let's trace Rebecca's lineage again.\n*   Rebecca is Harold's descendant.\n*   Harold is Ronald's descendant.\n*   Ronald's ancestor is Jerry.\n*   Jerry's ancestor is Nancy.\n*   Nancy's ancestor is Brenda.\n*   Brenda's ancestor is Austin.\n\nSo, Rebecca's lineage is: Rebecca <- Harold <- Ronald <- Jerry <- Nancy <- Brenda <- Austin.\nThis means Austin is Rebecca's ancestor.\n\nNow I need to see if Austin is in Janet's descendant chain.\nLet's check the chain I built for Janet.\n...\n*   Charles -> Tyler.\n*   Tyler -> Austin.\n\nSo Janet's chain ends with: ... -> Charles -> Tyler -> Austin.\n\nAnd Rebecca's chain starts with: Austin -> Brenda -> Nancy -> Jerry -> Ronald -> Harold -> Rebecca.\n\nThis means Janet is an ancestor of Austin.\nAnd Austin is an ancestor of Rebecca.\n\nTherefore, Janet is an ancestor of Rebecca.\n\nLet's double check the logic.\n1. \"Pamela is Janet's descendant.\" -> Janet is Pamela's

Jerry.\n*   Jerry's ancestor is Nancy.\n*   Nancy's ancestor is Brenda.\n*   Brenda's ancestor is Austin.\n\nSo, Rebecca's lineage is: Rebecca <- Harold <- Ronald <- Jerry <- Nancy <- Brenda <- Austin.\nThis means Austin is Rebecca's ancestor.\n\nNow I need to see if Austin is in Janet's descendant chain.\nLet's check the chain I built for Janet.\n...\n*   Charles -> Tyler.\n*   Tyler -> Austin.\n\nSo Janet's chain ends with: ... -> Charles -> Tyler -> Austin.\n\nAnd Rebecca's chain starts with: Austin -> Brenda -> Nancy -> Jerry -> Ronald -> Harold -> Rebecca.\n\nThis means Janet is

3.\n\nLet's re-read the question to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\"Determine the lineage relationship between Janet and Rebecca.\"\nThe options are:\n1. Janet is Rebecca's descendant. (Incorrect, I found the opposite)\n2. Janet and Rebecca share a common ancestor. (Incorrect, one is an ancestor of the other)\n3. Janet is Rebecca's ancestor.
