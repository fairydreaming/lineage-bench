Christina is Anna's descendant.\n\nWe need to determine relationship between Amber and Mary.\n\nFirst, we need to interpret these relationships.\n\nWe have a directed graph: \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X is an ancestor of Y (i.e., X is above Y in the lineage). \"X is Y's descendant\" means X is a descendant of Y (X is below Y). So we have both ancestor and descendant relationships.\n\nGiven these, we can infer relative positions.\n\nLet’s denote relationships:\n\n- Christina is Nicholas's ancestor: Christina -> Nicholas (ancestor)\n- Gregory is Michelle's descendant: Gregory is a descendant of Michelle: Michelle -> Gregory (descendant direction: from ancestor to descendant). So Michelle is ancestor of Gregory.\n\n- Nicholas is Michelle's ancestor: Nicholas -> Michelle (Nicholas is ancestor of Michelle). So Nicholas is above Michelle.\n\nThus we have Nicholas is ancestor of Michelle, and Michelle is ancestor of Gregory, so Nicholas is also ancestor of Gregory (by transitivity). Also Christina is ancestor of Nicholas, so Christina is ancestor of Nicholas, and thus also ancestor of Michelle and Gregory.\n\nThus we have: Christina -> Nicholas -> Michelle -> Gregory (a chain). So Christina is ancestor of Gregory.\n\nNow other statements:\n\n- Richard is Anna's ancestor: Richard -> Anna.\n\n- Richard is Mary's descendant: Mary is ancestor of Richard? Actually \"Richard is Mary's descendant\" means Richard is descendant of Mary, i.e., Mary -> Richard. So Mary is ancestor of Richard.\n\n- Christina is Anna's descendant: Christina is descendant of Anna, i.e., Anna -> Christina.\n\nThus we have: Anna is ancestor of Christina; Christina is ancestor of Nicholas; etc.\n\nAlso Richard is ancestor of Anna, and Mary is ancestor of Richard. So Mary -> Richard -> Anna -> Christina -> Nicholas -> Michelle -> Gregory -> (descendants of Gregory? Not given). And Amber is Gregory's descendant: Amber is descendant of Gregory: Gregory -> Amber (i.e., Amber is below Gregory).\n\nThus we have a chain:\n\nMary -> Richard -> Anna -> Christina -> Nicholas -> Michelle -> Gregory -> Amber.\n\nThus Amber is descendant of Gregory, and Gregory is descendant of Michelle, etc. So Amber is descendant of all above: Mary -> ... -> Amber.\n\nThus Amber is a descendant of Mary (since Mary is ancestor of Amber). So Amber is Mary's descendant. So answer #4: Amber is Mary's descendant.\n\nBut we need to verify that there are no other possibilities (like Amber is ancestor of Mary, or they share common ancestor, etc.). The chain suggests Amber is descendant of Mary. Let's double-check if any contradictions or alternative interpretations.\n\nGiven the relationships:\n\n1. Christina is Nicholas's ancestor: Christina is ancestor of Nicholas. So Christina is above Nicholas.\n\n2. Gregory is Michelle's descendant: Gregory is descendant of Michelle.

So Nicholas is above Michelle.\n\nThus we have Nicholas above Michelle, and Michelle above Gregory. So Nicholas is above Gregory (by transitivity).
