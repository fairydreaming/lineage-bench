The relationships given:\n\n1. Joshua is Sandra's descendant.\n2. Sandra is Katherine's descendant.\n3. Ronald is Katherine's ancestor.\n4. Walter is Joshua's descendant.\n5. Ronald is Matthew's ancestor.\n6. Walter is Donna's ancestor.\n7. Cheryl is Matthew's descendant.\n\nWe need to determine the lineage relationship between Donna and Cheryl.\n\nFirst, interpret the relationships: \"X is Y's descendant\" means X is a child, grandchild, etc. So Y is an ancestor of X. Similarly, \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X is an ancestor of Y. So we have a directed graph of ancestry.\n\nWe have multiple individuals: Joshua, Sandra, Katherine, Ronald, Walter, Donna, Matthew, Cheryl.\n\nGiven relationships:\n\n1. Joshua is Sandra's descendant. So Sandra is an ancestor of Joshua (maybe parent, grandparent, etc). So Sandra → Joshua (descendant direction). In graph terms: Sandra → Joshua (ancestor to descendant). Equivalent: Joshua is descendant of Sandra.\n\n2. Sandra is Katherine's descendant. So Katherine is ancestor of Sandra. So Katherine → Sandra.\n\nThus: Katherine is ancestor of Sandra, and Sandra is ancestor of Joshua. So Katherine is ancestor of Joshua via Sandra.\n\n3. Ronald is Katherine's ancestor. So Ronald → Katherine.\n\nThus: Ronald is ancestor of Katherine, who is ancestor of Sandra, who is ancestor of Joshua.\n\nThus, Ronald is ancestor of Joshua.\n\n4. Walter is Joshua's descendant. So Joshua → Walter.\n\nThus, Joshua is ancestor of Walter.\n\n5. Ronald is Matthew's ancestor. So Ronald → Matthew.\n\n6. Walter is Donna's ancestor. So Walter → Donna.\n\nThus, Walter is ancestor of Donna.\n\n7. Cheryl is Matthew's descendant. So Matthew → Cheryl.\n\nThus, Cheryl is descendant of Matthew.\n\nNow we have:\n\n- Ronald is ancestor of Katherine.\n- Katherine is ancestor of Sandra.\n- Sandra is ancestor of Joshua.\n- Joshua is ancestor of Walter.\n- Walter is ancestor of Donna.\n\nAlso, Ronald is ancestor of Matthew, and Matthew is ancestor of Cheryl.\n\nThus, the lineage structure:\n\nRonald\n ├── Katherine → Sandra → Joshua → Walter → Donna\n └── Matthew → Cheryl\n\nThus, we have two separate lines: one through Katherine, one through Matthew. Both lines start from Ronald.\n\nThus, Ronald is a common ancestor of Donna and Cheryl? Let's see: Donna is descendant of Ronald (via line: Ronald → Katherine → Sandra → Joshua → Walter → Donna). Yes, Donna is descendant of Ronald. Cheryl is descendant of Ronald (via line: Ronald → Matthew → Cheryl). So they share a common ancestor: Ronald.\n\nThus, answer: 2. \"Donna and Cheryl share a common ancestor.\"\n\nBut let's double-check: Are there any other relationships that might cause a different relationship? Let's verify the definitions: The statements are about descendant and ancestor relationships, which are transitive. The relationships we have:\n\n- Joshua is Sandra's descendant.\n- Sandra is Katherine's descendant.\nThus, Sandra is descendant of Katherine; Joshua is descendant of Sandra. So Joshua is descendant of Katherine as well (transitive). So Joshua is descendant of Katherine.\n\n- Walter is Joshua's descendant.\nThus, Joshua is ancestor of Walter, so Walter is descendant of Joshua, and thus descendant of Sandra, Katherine, etc.\n\n- Walter is Donna's ancestor.\nThus, Walter is ancestor of Donna, so Donna is descendant of Walter, and thus descendant of Joshua, etc.\n\n- Ronald is Katherine's ancestor.\nThus, Ronald is ancestor of Katherine, thus ancestor of Sandra, Joshua, Walter, Donna.\n\n- Ronald is Matthew's ancestor.\nThus, Ronald is ancestor of Matthew, and thus ancestor of Cheryl.\n\nThus, Donna is descendant of Ronald; Cheryl is descendant of Ronald; so they share a common ancestor Ronald.\n\nThus answer is 2.\n\nCheck the options:\n\n1. Donna and Cheryl share a common descendant. That would be if there is a person who is descendant of both, i.e., they have a child in common. That is not true; we have no relationship indicating they share a descendant.\n\n2. Donna and Cheryl share a common ancestor. Yes.\n\n3. Donna is Cheryl's descendant. No; Donna is not descendant of Cheryl.\n\n4. Donna is Cheryl's ancestor.
