Alexis is Eugene's descendant.\n7. Frances is William's ancestor.\n\nWe need to interpret these as genealogical relationships (ancestor/descendant). The puzzle likely expects us to infer relationships like \"Eugene is ... descendant/ancestor\" relative to Bradley, or they share a common ancestor or descendant.\n\nWe need to parse all relationships.\n\nLet’s denote individuals: D (Doris), M (Maria), B (Bradley), A (Alexis), H (Heather), W (William), F (Frances), E (Eugene).\n\nWe have directed edges: X is ancestor of Y means X -> Y (X ancestor of Y). Similarly Y descendant of X. So we have edges:\n\n- D -> M (D is Maria's ancestor).\n- B -> M (B is Maria's descendant). Actually \"Bradley is Maria's descendant\" means Bradley is descendant of Maria, i.e., Maria -> Bradley (M ancestor of B). So M -> B. So the edge is from Maria to Bradley (M ancestor of B). Equivalent to B descendant of M.\n\n- A -> H (Alexis is Heather's ancestor). So A ancestor of H.\n\n- W -> D (Doris is William's descendant). Wait: \"Doris is William's descendant.\" Means Doris is descendant of William, i.e., William ancestor of Doris. So W -> D. So edge from William to Doris.\n\n- F -> H (Frances is Heather's descendant). Wait: \"Frances is Heather's descendant.\" Means Frances descendant of Heather. So H -> F. So edge from Heather to Frances.\n\n- A -> E (Alexis is Eugene's descendant). Means Alexis is descendant of Eugene. So Eugene ancestor of Alexis. So E -> A.\n\n- F -> W (Frances is William's ancestor). Means Frances ancestor of William. So F -> W.\n\nThus we have a directed acyclic graph (assuming no cycles). Let's write edges:\n\n1. D -> M.\n2. M -> B.\n3. A -> H.\n4. W -> D.\n5. H -> F.\n6. E -> A.\n7. F -> W.\n\nThus we have edges:\n\n- W -> D -> M -> B.\n- E -> A -> H -> F -> W.\n- Also we have A -> H -> F -> W -> D -> M -> B.\n\nThus we have a chain:\n\nE -> A -> H -> F -> W -> D -> M -> B.\n\nThus Eugene is ancestor of Alexis (E->A), who is ancestor of Heather (A->H), who is ancestor of Frances (H->F), who is ancestor of William (F->W), who is ancestor of Doris (W->D), who is ancestor of Maria (D->M), who is ancestor of Bradley (M->B). So the chain from Eugene to Bradley is:\n\nEugene -> Alexis -> Heather -> Frances -> William -> Doris -> Maria -> Bradley.\n\nThus Eugene is a (great-...-) ancestor of Bradley (i.e., Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley). So answer 1: \"Eugene is Bradley's ancestor.\"\n\nBut need to check if any other relationships could be considered: \"Eugene and Bradley share a common ancestor.\" That would be true if they have a common ancestor, but they also have a direct ancestor relationship. The question asks \"Determine the lineage relationship between Eugene and Bradley.\" It could be ambiguous: we have to choose the correct answer among the five options.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n1. Eugene is Bradley's ancestor.\n2. Eugene and Bradley share a common ancestor.\n3. Eugene is Bradley's descendant.\n4. Eugene and Bradley share a common descendant.\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nWe found that Eugene is ancestor of Bradley (the chain includes Eugene at top, Bradley at bottom). So answer 1 is correct.\n\nBut we must ensure that the graph does not have any contradictions or missing edges that could allow alternative relationships.\n\nLet's examine all statements to ensure they are consistent.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Doris is Maria's ancestor: D -> M.\n\n- Bradley is Maria's descendant: M -> B.\n\n- Alexis is Heather's ancestor: A -> H.\n\n- Doris is William's descendant: D descendant of William: W -> D.\n\n- Frances is Heather's descendant: F descendant of H: H -> F.\n\n- Alexis is Eugene's descendant: A descendant of Eugene: E -> A.\n\n- Frances is William's ancestor: F ancestor of William: F -> W.\n\nThus we have a partial order.\n\nWe can try to see if any cycles are introduced:\n\nChain: E -> A -> H -> F -> W -> D -> M -> B.\n\nCheck if any statements conflict: e.g., W -> D and D -> M, M -> B.
