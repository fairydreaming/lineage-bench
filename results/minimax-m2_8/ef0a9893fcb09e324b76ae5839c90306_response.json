Means Mason is a descendant of Angela (i.e., Angela is an ancestor of Mason). Or could be \"Mason is Angela's descendant\" meaning Mason is a descendant of Angela. So Angela is the ancestor, Mason is descendant.\n\n- Sandra is Joan's ancestor. Means Sandra is an ancestor of Joan (i.e., Sandra is older generation, Joan is descendant). So Sandra -> Joan (ancestor to descendant).\n\n- Sharon is Diana's ancestor. Sharon is ancestor of Diana.\n\n- Brittany is Sandra's ancestor. Means Brittany is ancestor of Sandra. So Brittany is older generation relative to Sandra.\n\n- Joan is Sharon's ancestor. Means Joan is ancestor of Sharon.\n\n- Christina is Diana's descendant. Means Christina is descendant of Diana (Diana is ancestor).\n\n- Christina is Mason's ancestor. Means Christina is ancestor of Mason.\n\nGoal: Determine relationship between Angela and Brittany.\n\nWe need to see if Angela is descendant of Brittany, or Angela is ancestor of Brittany, or they share a common ancestor, or share a common descendant, or none.\n\nLet's map out generational relationships.\n\nWe have individuals: Mason, Angela, Sandra, Joan, Sharon, Diana, Brittany, Christina.\n\nGiven relationships:\n\n1. Mason is Angela's descendant. So Angela -> Mason (ancestor to descendant). So Angela is older generation relative to Mason.\n\n2. Sandra is Joan's ancestor. So Sandra -> Joan (Sandra older, Joan descendant).\n\n3. Sharon is Diana's ancestor. So Sharon -> Diana.\n\n4. Brittany is Sandra's ancestor. So Brittany -> Sandra.\n\n5. Joan is Sharon's ancestor. So Joan -> Sharon.\n\n6. Christina is Diana's descendant. So Diana -> Christina.\n\n7. Christina is Mason's ancestor. So Christina -> Mason.\n\nThus we have a network.\n\nLet's denote each person as a node with generational depth (relative). Let's assign arbitrary generations: older = higher generation number? Usually ancestor is older generation. Let's assign generation numbers: older generation has larger number? Actually we can think of root as highest generation number (like generation 0 is the oldest). Or we can assign generation numbers such that ancestor has smaller number (like generation 1 is older than generation 2). Let's just treat relationships as directed edges from ancestor to descendant.\n\nGraph:\n\n- Angela -> Mason.\n\n- Sandra -> Joan.\n\n- Sharon -> Diana.\n\n- Brittany -> Sandra.\n\n- Joan -> Sharon.\n\n- Diana -> Christina.\n\n- Christina -> Mason.\n\nThus we have two chains: Angela -> Mason, and also Christina -> Mason (multiple ancestors converge on Mason). So Mason has at least two ancestors: Angela and Christina.\n\nNow, we need to see where Brittany fits relative to Angela.\n\nWe have Brittany -> Sandra -> Joan -> Sharon -> Diana -> Christina -> Mason.\n\nThus Brittany is ancestor of Sandra, which is ancestor of Joan, etc., eventually reaching Mason (via Christina). So Brittany is an ancestor of Mason. Also Angela is ancestor of Mason. So Angela and Brittany are both ancestors of Mason.\n\nThus they share a common descendant (Mason). So answer 4: Angela and Brittany share a common descendant.\n\nBut we must verify if any other relationship holds: Are they also share a common ancestor? Possibly they could share a common ancestor (if they are both descendants of someone else). Let's see: Does any relationship indicate that Angela is a descendant of some person that is also ancestor of Brittany? Or that they both share a common descendant? The only common descendant is Mason (and possibly Christina? Actually Christina is descendant of Diana, not necessarily of Angela or Brittany; but Christina is ancestor of Mason, not descendant. So not that). Let's see if there is any relationship that says Angela is descendant of someone else besides being ancestor of Mason. Not given. So we cannot infer that Angela is descendant of anyone else. So we cannot say they share a common ancestor.\n\nThus answer 4 is correct.\n\nBut let's double-check the relationships: \"Mason is Angela's descendant.\" Means Mason is descendant of Angela. So Angela is ancestor. \"Sandra is Joan's ancestor.\" Means Sandra is ancestor of Joan. \"Sharon is Diana's ancestor.\" Means Sharon is ancestor of Diana. \"Brittany is Sandra's ancestor.\" Means Brittany is ancestor of Sandra. \"Joan is Sharon's ancestor.\" Means Joan is ancestor of Sharon. \"Christina is Diana's descendant.\" Means Christina is descendant of Diana. \"Christina is Mason's ancestor.\" Means Christina is ancestor of Mason.\n\nThus we have:\n\n- Angela (older) -> Mason (younger)\n\n- Sandra (older) -> Joan (younger)\n\n- Sharon (older) -> Diana (younger)\n\n- Brittany (older) -> Sandra (younger)\n\n- Joan (older) -> Sharon (younger)\n\n- Diana (older) -> Christina (younger)\n\n- Christina (older) -> Mason (younger)\n\nThus we have a chain: Brittany -> Sandra -> Joan -> Sharon -> Diana -> Christina -> Mason.\n\nAlso we have Angela -> Mason.\n\nThus Angela and Brittany are both ancestors of Mason, so they share a common descendant (Mason). However, also note that Christina is ancestor of Mason, and also descendant of Diana, which is descendant of Sharon, etc. So the chain from Brittany to Mason includes Christina as intermediate. So indeed they share a descendant Mason.\n\nThus answer 4 is correct.\n\nBut we need to ensure that \"share a common descendant\" means they have at least one descendant in common. Indeed both Angela and Brittany have Mason as a descendant (Angela is ancestor of Mason, Brittany is ancestor of Mason via chain). So they share a common descendant (Mason). So answer 4.\n\nThus answer: <ANSWER>4</ANSWER>.\n\nWe should double-check if any other answer could be considered correct. Let's examine each answer:\n\n1. Angela is Brittany's descendant. That would mean Angela is younger than Brittany, i.e., Angela is descendant of Brittany. But we have no relationship stating that. There's no chain from Brittany to Angela. The only chain from Brittany goes through Sandra, Joan, Sharon, Diana, Christina, to Mason. There's no link to Angela. So no.\n\n2. Angela and Brittany share a common ancestor. That would mean there exists some older person who is ancestor of both Angela and Brittany. We have no information about any common ancestor. Could there be a hidden one? Possibly if we consider that Angela might be descendant of some unknown older person that is also ancestor of Brittany. But we have no evidence. The given relationships do not indicate any common ancestor. So answer 2 is not supported.\n\n3. Angela is Brittany's ancestor. That would mean Angela is older than Brittany. But we have Angela is older than Mason, and Brittany is older than Sandra, etc. There's no direct relationship linking Angela and Brittany. But could Angela be older than Brittany? Possibly, but not indicated. In the chain, we have Brittany -> ... -> Mason, and Angela -> Mason. So they both are ancestors of Mason. Without further info, we cannot claim one is ancestor of the other. So answer 3 is not correct.\n\n4. Angela and Brittany share a common descendant. This is correct as we identified. So answer 4.\n\n5. None of the above is correct. Not correct because answer 4 is correct.\n\nThus answer is 4.\n\nThus we output <ANSWER>4</ANSWER>.\n\nNow we must follow the output format: The answer number enclosed in <ANSWER> tags.
