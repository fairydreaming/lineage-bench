The relationships are:\n\n- Mason is Angela's descendant.\n- Sandra is Joan's ancestor.\n- Sharon is Diana's ancestor.\n- Brittany is Sandra's ancestor.\n- Joan is Sharon's ancestor.\n- Christina is Diana's descendant.\n- Christina is Mason's ancestor.\n\nGoal: Determine the lineage relationship between Angela and Brittany. Options:\n\n1. Angela is Brittany's descendant.\n2. Angela and Brittany share a common ancestor.\n3. Angela is Brittany's ancestor.\n4. Angela and Brittany share a common descendant.\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nWe need to interpret \"descendant\" and \"ancestor\". Typically, a descendant is a person who is lower in the generational chain; ancestor is higher. The relationships given are not necessarily immediate; they could be direct or indirect.\n\nGiven:\n\n1. Mason is Angela's descendant => Angela is Mason's ancestor (or at least an ancestor of Mason). So Mason is descendant of Angela.\n\n2. Sandra is Joan's ancestor => Sandra is an ancestor of Joan. So Joan is descendant of Sandra.\n\n3. Sharon is Diana's ancestor => Sharon is ancestor of Diana. So Diana is descendant of Sharon.\n\n4. Brittany is Sandra's ancestor => Brittany is ancestor of Sandra. So Sandra is descendant of Brittany.\n\n5. Joan is Sharon's ancestor => Joan is ancestor of Sharon. So Sharon is descendant of Joan.\n\n6. Christina is Diana's descendant => Christina is descendant of Diana. So Diana is ancestor of Christina.\n\n7. Christina is Mason's ancestor => Christina is ancestor of Mason. So Mason is descendant of Christina.\n\nWe need to combine these relationships to deduce the relationship between Angela and Brittany.\n\nLet’s denote individuals: Angela, Mason, Sandra, Joan, Sharon, Diana, Brittany, Christina.\n\nWe have the following directed relationships (ancestor -> descendant). Let's denote A → B meaning A is ancestor of B (i.e., B is descendant of A). So:\n\n- Angela → Mason (since Mason is Angela's descendant)\n- Sandra → Joan (since Sandra is Joan's ancestor)\n- Sharon → Diana (Sharon is Diana's ancestor)\n- Brittany → Sandra (Brittany is Sandra's ancestor)\n- Joan → Sharon (Joan is Sharon's ancestor)\n- Diana → Christina (Christina is Diana's descendant)\n- Christina → Mason (Christina is Mason's ancestor)\n\nThus we have a chain: Let’s see.\n\nFrom Brittany → Sandra → Joan → Sharon → Diana → Christina → Mason → (Mason is descendant of Angela). Wait we also have Angela → Mason.\n\nThus we have a directed graph of ancestry. Let's try to see if there are any cycles or contradictions.\n\nWe have:\n\nBrittany → Sandra\nSandra → Joan\nJoan → Sharon\nSharon → Diana\nDiana → Christina\nChristina → Mason\nAngela → Mason\n\nThus we have a chain: Brittany → Sandra → Joan → Sharon → Diana → Christina → Mason. Also Angela → Mason. So both Brittany and Angela are ancestors of Mason (through possibly different paths). So we can deduce that Brittany and Angela are both ancestors of Mason. So they share a common descendant (Mason). Also they might be ancestors of each other? Let's check if there is any relationship between Brittany and Angela.\n\nWe have no direct relationship given between Angela and Brittany. However, we can deduce that they both are ancestors of Mason, which is a common descendant. So they share a common descendant (Mason). Option 4 says \"Angela and Brittany share a common descendant.\" That matches.\n\nOption 2 says \"Angela and Brittany share a common ancestor.\" That would be if they share a parent or some earlier ancestor. Not given. There is no information that they share a common ancestor. They share a common descendant (Mason). So answer is 4.\n\nBut let's double-check that there are no other possibilities: Option 1 \"Angela is Brittany's descendant.\" That would mean Angela is descendant of Brittany. That would be: Brittany → ... → Angela. But we have no path from Brittany to Angela; we have path from Brittany to Mason and from Angela to Mason. So no.\n\nOption 3 \"Angela is Brittany's ancestor.\" That would mean Angela → ... → Brittany. No.\n\nOption 2: share a common ancestor. There is no mention of any common ancestor. They share a common descendant.\n\nThus answer is 4.\n\nBut we must be careful: The phrasing \"share a common descendant\" is a bit unusual because typically we talk about common ancestors. But it's plausible: If two people are both ancestors of a third person, they share that third person as a common descendant. So that is correct.\n\nThus answer: <ANSWER>4</ANSWER>.\n\nBut let's verify the logic thoroughly.\n\nWe have the relationships:\n\n- Mason is Angela's descendant. So Mason is a descendant of Angela. So Angela is an ancestor of Mason.\n\n- Sandra is Joan's ancestor. So Sandra is an ancestor of Joan.\n\n- Sharon is Diana's ancestor. So Sharon is an ancestor of Diana.\n\n- Brittany is Sandra's ancestor. So Brittany is an ancestor of Sandra.\n\n- Joan is Sharon's ancestor. So Joan is an ancestor of Sharon.\n\n- Christina is Diana's descendant. So Diana is an ancestor of Christina.\n\n- Christina is Mason's ancestor. So Christina is an ancestor of Mason.\n\nThus we have:\n\nBrittany → Sandra → Joan → Sharon → Diana → Christina → Mason.\n\nAngela → Mason.\n\nThus Angela and Brittany both are ancestors of Mason. So they share a common descendant: Mason.\n\nThus answer is 4.\n\nCheck if there is any contradictory relationship that might cause a cycle or different interpretation: Could there be a scenario where Angela is also a descendant of Brittany? Let's see: If there is a path from Brittany to Angela, then they would be ancestors/descendants. But we have no such path. The only path from Brittany goes down to Mason. Angela is also ancestor of Mason, but not descendant of Brittany. So they are not directly related.\n\nThus answer is indeed 4.\n\nThus the answer: <ANSWER>4</ANSWER>.\n\nBut the question: \"Determine the lineage relationship between Angela and Brittany.\" The options include \"share a common descendant\" which is not exactly a relationship between them (like ancestor/descendant) but a relationship of them sharing a descendant. That is a relationship between them (they have a common descendant).
