We need to determine the relationship between Andrea and Karen. The statements:\n\n1. Sandra is Beverly's descendant.\n2. Sandra is Christine's ancestor.\n3. Beverly is Samuel's descendant.\n4. Terry is Samuel's ancestor.\n5. Alice is Christine's ancestor.\n6. Alice is Karen's descendant.\n7. Terry is Andrea's descendant.\n\nWe need to deduce the relationship between Andrea and Karen. The answer choices:\n\n1. Andrea and Karen share a common ancestor.\n2. Andrea and Karen share a common descendant.\n3. Andrea is Karen's descendant.\n4. Andrea is Karen's ancestor.\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nWe need to find the correct answer.\n\nFirst, let's parse the relationships:\n\n- \"X is Y's descendant\": X is a descendant of Y (i.e., Y is an ancestor of X). So \"Sandra is Beverly's descendant\" means Sandra is descendant of Beverly. So Beverly is ancestor of Sandra.\n\n- \"X is Y's ancestor\": X is an ancestor of Y (i.e., Y is descendant of X). So \"Sandra is Christine's ancestor\" means Sandra is ancestor of Christine. So Christine is descendant of Sandra.\n\n- \"Beverly is Samuel's descendant\": So Beverly is descendant of Samuel, i.e., Samuel is ancestor of Beverly.\n\n- \"Terry is Samuel's ancestor\": So Terry is ancestor of Samuel, i.e., Samuel is descendant of Terry.\n\n- \"Alice is Christine's ancestor\": So Alice is ancestor of Christine.\n\n- \"Alice is Karen's descendant\": So Alice is descendant of Karen, i.e., Karen is ancestor of Alice.\n\n- \"Terry is Andrea's descendant\": So Terry is descendant of Andrea, i.e., Andrea is ancestor of Terry.\n\nThus we have a partial genealogical graph.\n\nGoal: Determine relationship between Andrea and Karen.\n\nWe need to find if there is a path between them in the ancestry graph.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite statements as edges:\n\nLet A be Andrea, K be Karen, Sd be Sandra, Bv be Beverly, Cb be Christine, Sm be Samuel, Tr be Terry, Al be Alice.\n\n- Sd is descendant of Bv => Bv -> Sd (Bv ancestor of Sd). So edge Bv -> Sd (Bv -> Sd means Bv is ancestor, Sd is descendant).\n\n- Sd is ancestor of Christine => Sd -> Cb (Sd ancestor of Cb). So edge Sd -> Cb.\n\n- Bv is descendant of Samuel => Bv -> Sm? Actually \"Beverly is Samuel's descendant\" means Beverly descendant of Samuel, i.e., Samuel ancestor of Beverly. So edge Sm -> Bv.\n\n- Terry is ancestor of Samuel => Tr -> Sm.\n\n- Alice is ancestor of Christine => Al -> Cb.\n\n- Alice is descendant of Karen => K -> Al (Karen ancestor of Alice).\n\n- Terry is descendant of Andrea => Andrea -> Tr.\n\nThus we have:\n\n- K -> Al -> Cb.\n\n- Sm -> Bv -> Sd -> Cb.\n\n- Tr -> Sm -> Bv -> Sd -> Cb.\n\n- Andrea -> Tr.\n\nThus we have:\n\nAndrea (A) -> Tr (Terry) -> Sm (Samuel) -> Bv (Beverly) -> Sd (Sandra) -> Cb (Christine). Also we have Al (Alice) -> Cb (Christine). Also K (Karen) -> Al.\n\nThus we have:\n\nK -> Al -> Cb.\n\nA -> Tr -> Sm -> Bv -> Sd -> Cb.\n\nWe also have that Sd -> Cb, but also Bv -> Sd -> Cb. So we have a chain: A -> Tr -> Sm -> Bv -> Sd -> Cb.\n\nNow we need relationship between Andrea (A) and Karen (K). There is no direct given relationship, but we can see if they share a common ancestor or descendant.\n\nWe have A -> Tr -> Sm -> ... and K -> Al -> Cb. The two lineages converge at Cb? Actually Cb is a descendant of both? Let's see:\n\n- Cb is a descendant of Al (via Al -> Cb). So Cb is descendant of Al.\n\n- Cb is also descendant of Sd, which is descendant of Bv, which is descendant of Sm, which is descendant of Tr, which is descendant of A. So Cb is descendant of A as well? Let's check: A -> Tr -> Sm -> Bv -> Sd -> Cb. So yes, Cb is descendant of A.\n\nThus Cb is descendant of both Al (and thus K) and A. So both A and K have a common descendant: Cb.\n\nThus the relationship: Andrea and Karen share a common descendant (Christine). That matches answer choice 2.\n\nBut we must verify that \"common descendant\" is defined correctly: Andrea is an ancestor of Christine (via chain). Karen is also an ancestor of Christine (via K -> Al -> Cb). So they share a common descendant: Christine. So answer 2.\n\nBut we need to be careful: Are there any other possible relationships? Could Andrea be ancestor of Karen? Let's see: A -> Tr -> Sm -> Bv -> Sd -> Cb. K -> Al -> Cb. So they both are ancestors of Cb. But does A have any relationship to K? Not given. Could K be descendant of A? No, because A's chain goes down to Cb, but K's chain goes down to Al and then Cb. There is no direct chain between A and K.\n\nThus answer 2: Andrea and Karen share a common descendant.\n\nThus answer: <ANSWER>2</ANSWER>.\n\nBut let's double-check the logic thoroughly and consider any alternative interpretations. The statements are given in natural language, but we must interpret \"descendant\" and \"ancestor\" correctly. Usually \"X is Y's descendant\" means X is a descendant of Y, i.e., Y is an ancestor of X. So we have correctly reversed edges.\n\nCheck each statement:\n\n- Sandra is Beverly's descendant => Sandra descendant of Beverly => Beverly is ancestor of Sandra.\n\n- Sandra is Christine's ancestor => Sandra ancestor of Christine => Christine descendant of Sandra.\n\n- Beverly is Samuel's descendant => Beverly descendant of Samuel => Samuel is ancestor of Beverly.\n\n- Terry is Samuel's ancestor => Terry ancestor of Samuel => Samuel descendant of Terry.\n\n- Alice is Christine's ancestor => Alice ancestor of Christine => Christine descendant of Alice.\n\n- Alice is Karen's descendant => Alice descendant of Karen => Karen ancestor of Alice.\n\n- Terry is Andrea's descendant => Terry descendant of Andrea => Andrea ancestor of Terry.\n\nThus we have:\n\n- Beverly ancestor of Sandra ancestor of Christine.\n\n- Samuel ancestor of Beverly descendant of Sandra.\n\n- Terry ancestor of Samuel.\n\n- Andrea ancestor of Terry.\n\n- Karen ancestor of Alice ancestor of Christine.\n\nThus we have a graph:\n\nAndrea -> Terry -> Samuel -> Beverly -> Sandra -> Christine.\n\nKaren -> Alice -> Christine.\n\nThus Andrea and Karen both are ancestors of Christine. So they share a common descendant: Christine.\n\nThus answer 2 is correct.\n\nNow double-check that \"common descendant\" means that they share a descendant that is a descendant of both. Christine is descendant of both Andrea (via chain) and Karen (via chain). So they share a common descendant.\n\nThus answer 2.\n\nThus the answer: <ANSWER>2</ANSWER>.\n\nNow we need to output exactly that.\n\nThus final answer: <ANSWER>2</ANSWER>.\n\nBut we should also consider if there is any nuance: The problem may be designed to test ability to parse relationships and deduce that both Andrea and Karen are ancestors of Christine, thus they share a common descendant. The answer choices:\n\n1. Andrea and Karen share a common ancestor.\n\n2. Andrea and Karen share a common descendant.\n\n3. Andrea is Karen's descendant.\n\n4. Andrea is Karen's ancestor.\n\n5.
