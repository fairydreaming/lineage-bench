Pamela connects to Denise in the family lineage, continuing the path from Emma. The connections extend through Helen and Gregory, ultimately reaching Dorothy.

I see a complex genealogical connection emerging. The relationships trace a path from Alice through multiple generations: Alice → Sara → Patrick → Kelly → Emily. This sequence reveals interconnected ancestral links, showing how different family members are related across generations. The lineage demonstrates a detailed mapping of familial connections, tracing ancestral paths through multiple individuals.\n\nSimultaneously, another branch connects Randy to Emily through a different set of ancestors: Eugene → Virginia → Mary → Diane → Ryan → Wayne → Randy → Emily.
