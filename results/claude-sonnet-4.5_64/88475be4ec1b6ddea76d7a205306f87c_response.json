Marilyn is Jennifer's descendant.\n\nI notice Douglas is Janet's descendant, which could be a key connection point. I'll continue tracing potential paths to Harold through these family relationships. Harold's lineage traces through multiple family connections. Jeffrey descends from Harold, linking to Lisa and Elijah. Ryan becomes part of this ancestral path, connecting to Kathleen and Cheryl. The line continues through Heather, Susan, and Catherine, eventually reaching Stephanie. Sarah and Sandra follow, leading to Julia and Kenneth. Matthew emerges in the sequence, with Evelyn as his descendant. I see Richard connects to Helen, who descends from Hannah. Sara is Hannah's ancestor, with Lauren being Sara's ancestor. Lauren relates to Christina, who descends from Debra. Karen is Debra's ancestor and descends from Douglas, who is a descendant of Janet.
