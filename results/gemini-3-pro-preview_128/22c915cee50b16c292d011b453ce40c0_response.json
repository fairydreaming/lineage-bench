This involves creating nodes for each person and directed edges to denote the \"parent of\" connections. Initially, I'm focusing on ensuring data integrity. I'm carefully analyzing the relationship list, making sure there are no circular dependencies. Once that is done, I can proceed with the next steps.\n\n\n**Refining Relationship Mapping**\n\nNow, I'm working on transforming the provided relations into a clear ancestor-descendant format. I'm focusing on consistency: $A \\to B$ means A is an ancestor. I'm carefully converting each given relationship to this standard form. I'm translating, for example, \"Patrick is Zachary's descendant\" to $Zachary \\to Patrick$. This creates a consistent base for building the genealogical structure.\n\n\n**Establishing Genealogical Connections**\n\nI've been busy converting each given relationship into the standard \"ancestor-descendant\" format.

This follows established patterns, and I'm ensuring all data, like the relationships linking Stephen to Charles, accurately reflect the standard format. I'm confident in the structure's accuracy.\n\n\n**Charting Complete Ancestry**\n\nI'm finalizing the ancestral network by integrating the last provided relations, ensuring a complete genealogical structure. The new connections are: James to Charles, Charles to Kimberly, Kimberly to Stephanie, Stephanie to Logan, Logan to Catherine, Catherine to James, Jesse to Hannah, and Hannah to Gerald. The focus is to include every detail within the established \"$Ancestor \\to Descendant$\" paradigm. I'm now integrating the provided relations into the established genealogical framework. The data is complete, and I'm confident in the final structure.\n\n\n**Tracing Ultimate Ancestry**\n\nI'm presently building upon the existing structure by incorporating the final ancestral relations: $George \\to Theresa$ and so forth, creating an unbroken chain. Every fact directly becomes another connection. I'm focusing on ensuring absolute clarity, consistently adhering to the standardized \"$Ancestor \\to Descendant$\" format. The goal is to create a complete and cohesive genealogical map, from Sophia to Theresa.\n\n\n**Building Final Lineage**\n\nI'm currently incorporating the final relationships into my genealogical framework: $Joe \\to Harold$, $Harold \\to Thomas$, and $Thomas \\to Terry$.
