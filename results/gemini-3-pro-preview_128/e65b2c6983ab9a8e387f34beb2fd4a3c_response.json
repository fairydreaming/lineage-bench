My immediate goal is to transform the raw information into a usable structure. I'm leaning toward a directed graph to represent the family tree, which seems like the most effective way to visualize and then traverse the connections between Janice and Betty.\n\n\n**Mapping Family Tree Structure**\n\nThe current process involves extracting Janice's ancestors and comparing them to Betty's. Building on the previous work, I am now mapping the complete ancestry of Janice, starting from Janice herself, all the way up to Helen's ancestor, Katherine. The next step is to examine the relationships involving Betty and look for overlaps.\n\n\n**Charting Ancestral Paths**\n\nThe lineage data is now parsed and I've started tracing paths.  Specifically, I'm working on the ancestral chain from Janice, expanding the tree using the provided relationships.  I am building up the full ancestral path for Janice. Simultaneously, I am preparing to work on a similar process for Betty.\n\n\n**Identifying Family Relationships**\n\nMy current focus is on pinpointing the relationship between Janice and Betty using the provided data.
