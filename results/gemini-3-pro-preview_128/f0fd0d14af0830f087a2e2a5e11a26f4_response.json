Now, I have verified the path and its direction: Keith is an ancestor to ... and now, to Betty.\n\n\n**Validating Lineage Expansion**\n\nI have reviewed the complete lineage graph, focusing on the recent additions: Steven is Scott's ancestor, Scott is Carl's ancestor, Julia is Carl's descendant, Jean is Julia's descendant, Russell is Anna's ancestor, Anna is Gregory's ancestor, Gregory is Eugene's ancestor, Jack is Eugene's descendant, Natalie is Alexis's ancestor, and Teresa is Thomas's ancestor. I have validated all these connections.\n\n\n**Validating Extended Relationships**\n\nI'm now integrating the final data into the lineage graph. I'm verifying the new connections, which include  *Thomas to Sean, Sean to Ann, Ann to Brian, Brian to Sharon, Sharon to Noah, Noah to Bobby, Bobby to Ashley, Ashley to Jesse, Jesse to Henry, Henry to Kathleen, Kathleen to Isabella, Isabella to Jeffrey, Jeffrey to Debra, Debra to Mary, Mary to Grace, Grace to Evelyn,* and *Evelyn to Ronald.* I'm now cross-checking and validating all relationships in the complete network to confirm the structure and accuracy of the connections.\n\n\n**Confirming Final Connections**\n\nI've just added the final relationships to the graph, including Ronald to Kimberly, Kimberly to Daniel, Daniel to Zachary, Zachary to Christian, Christian to Michael, Michael to Jennifer, Jennifer to Ethan, Ethan to Cheryl, Cheryl to Joshua, Joshua to Timothy, Timothy to Alexander, Alexander to Angela, Angela to Roy, Roy to Terry, and Terry to Gloria. Frances is Gloria's descendant. I'm verifying each newly added link and confirming their positions in the extended lineage map.\n\n\n**Refining Lineage Graph**\n\nI've just processed the final data points and incorporated them into the family tree, completing the directed graph structure. I'm now meticulously reviewing each individual connection, tracing ancestry paths to validate the relationship between Keith and Betty. The final step involves confirming the entire structure, with the additional connections, ensuring the integrity of the relationships and the accuracy of the overall lineage.\n\n**Verifying Final Linkages**\n\nI've just finished integrating these new data points: Sophia to Betty, including tracing ancestry paths to validate the relationship between Keith and Betty. I'm reviewing the final connections added to ensure their place in the lineage. I am now double-checking and confirming that the expanded network has been accurately integrated.\n\n\n**Establishing Final Lineage Path**\n\nI've just concluded the final checks of the lineage graph, validating the path from Keith to Betty. I've re-evaluated all connections within the entire graph to guarantee a clear ancestral connection from Keith to Betty, encompassing the entire family tree network. After careful review, I've confirmed that all relationships have been correctly interpreted and incorporated, concluding that Keith is indeed Betty's ancestor.\n\n\n**Defining Ancestry Conclusion**\n\nI'm now fully confident about my findings. After rigorously re-evaluating the connections within the complete family tree, I've confirmed that Keith's path to Betty's lineage is accurately represented and verified. All relationships have been interpreted and integrated correctly, finalizing that Keith is indeed Betty's ancestor.\n\n\n**Concluding Ancestral Link**\n\nI'm wrapping up the final validation. I've re-examined the entire path from Keith to Betty within the expanded graph. I can confidently confirm their ancestral connection is accurately represented, with all data points accounted for. The network now reflects the final lineage reconstruction with the integrated connections, solidifying Keith as Betty's ancestor.\n\n\n**Tracing Betty's Lineage**\n\nI'm now integrating the final path from Keith to Betty: Denise is Kyle's ancestor, Kyle is Elijah's ancestor, Elijah is Anthony's ancestor, Anthony is Bradley's ancestor, Bradley is Wayne's ancestor, Wayne is John's ancestor, John is Dylan's ancestor, Dylan is Billy's ancestor, Billy is Linda's ancestor, Linda is Kelly's ancestor, Kelly is Sophia's ancestor, and Sophia is Betty's ancestor. My validation is
