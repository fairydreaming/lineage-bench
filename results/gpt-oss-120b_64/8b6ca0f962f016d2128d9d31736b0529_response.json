Also maybe other indirect connections.\n\nEmma appears only in statement 63: Emma is Jose's ancestor (Emma -> Jose). Also Jose appears in statement 34: Jason is Jose's descendant (Jose -> Jason).

Also Frank is descendant of Christopher (Christopher -> Frank). So chain: Christopher -> Frank -> Scott.\n\nAlso Christine -> Christopher, so Christine -> Christopher -> Frank -> Scott.\n\nAlso maybe other connections: any other edges leading to Christopher? Not else.\n\nNow Emma -> Jose -> Jason -> Bryan? Wait Jason -> Bryan (edge 51). So chain: Emma -> Jose -> Jason -> Bryan.\n\nBryan -> Russell (edge5). Russell -> James (37). James -> Juan (7).

And we loop back to Christopher.\n\nThus we have a huge chain connecting Emma to many nodes, eventually reaching Christopher, which leads to Frank and Scott.\n\nThus there is a path from Emma to Scott? Let's see direction: Emma -> ... -> Christopher -> Frank -> Scott. Yes, we have Emma as ancestor of many, leading to Christopher, then Frank, then Scott. So Emma is an ancestor of Scott (i.e., Emma -> ... -> Scott). Therefore Scott is descendant of Emma.\n\nThus relationship: Scott is Emma's descendant.
