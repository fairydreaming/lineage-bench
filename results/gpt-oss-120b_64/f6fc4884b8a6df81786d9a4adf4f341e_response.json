Also we have Robert descendant of Beverly (16). So chain: Beverly -> Robert -> Brandon (Beverly ancestor of Robert, Robert ancestor of Brandon). Also we have Samantha ancestor of Beverly (2). So Samantha -> Beverly -> Robert -> Brandon.\n\nAlso we have other connections maybe linking to Elijah.\n\nElijah ancestor of Harold (24). Harold ancestor of Michael (39). Also Bobby descendant of Michael (55). Also Bobby ancestor of Philip (48). Also Ralph descendant of Philip (13). Also Ralph ancestor of Karen (42). Karen ancestor of Denise (40). Denise ancestor of Patricia (60). Patricia ancestor of Mason (51). Diana descendant of Mason (15). Amy descendant of Diana (46). Amy ancestor of Gabriel (52). Gabriel ancestor of Dorothy (9). Dorothy ancestor of Andrea (23). Mary descendant of Andrea (1). Kathleen descendant of Mary (54). Brian descendant of Kathleen (56). Brian ancestor of Madison (20). Madison ancestor of Pamela (29).

Abigail ancestor of Albert (7). Sandra descendant of Albert (17). Rachel descendant of Sandra (25). Justin descendant of Rachel (57). Teresa descendant of Justin (19). Teresa ancestor of Janet (8). Arthur descendant of Janet (49). Arthur ancestor of Amanda (41). Lawrence descendant of Amanda (45). Alice descendant of Lawrence (10). Megan descendant of Alice (21). Megan ancestor of Alan (58). Alan ancestor of Cynthia (35). Samantha descendant of Cynthia (3). So Samantha is descendant of Cynthia, which is descendant of Alan, which is ancestor of ... Wait: Alan ancestor of Cynthia, so Cynthia descendant of Alan. Samantha descendant of Cynthia, so Samantha descendant of Alan as well. Also Samantha ancestor of Beverly (2). So chain: Alan -> Cynthia -> Samantha -> Beverly -> Robert -> Brandon.\n\nNow we have Elijah chain: Elijah ancestor of Harold -> Michael -> (Bobby descendant of Michael) -> (Bobby ancestor of Philip) -> (Ralph descendant of Philip) -> (Ralph ancestor of Karen) -> (Karen ancestor of Denise) -> (Denise ancestor of Patricia) -> (Patricia ancestor of Mason) -> (Diana descendant of Mason) -> (Amy descendant of Diana) -> (Amy ancestor of Gabriel) -> (Gabriel ancestor of Dorothy) -> (Dorothy ancestor of Andrea) -> (Mary descendant of Andrea) -> (Kathleen descendant of Mary) -> (Brian descendant of Kathleen) -> (Brian ancestor of Madison) -> (Madison ancestor of Pamela) -> (Kevin descendant of Pamela) -> (Kevin ancestor of William) -> (Tyler descendant of William) -> (Tyler ancestor of Carl) -> (Danielle descendant of Carl) -> (Brenda descendant of Danielle) -> (Heather descendant of Brenda) -> (Jerry descendant of Heather) -> (Jerry ancestor of Ruth) -> (Ruth ancestor of Mark) -> (Logan descendant of Mark) -> (Logan ancestor of George) -> (Vincent descendant of George) -> (Vincent ancestor of Margaret) -> (Zachary descendant of Margaret) -> (Zachary ancestor of Kelly) -> (Jennifer descendant of Kelly) -> (Richard descendant of Jennifer) -> (Richard ancestor of Bryan) -> (Ryan descendant of Bryan) -> (Christine descendant of Ryan) -> (Christine ancestor of Janice) -> (Stephen descendant of Janice) -> (Stephen ancestor of Charles) -> (Charles ancestor of Melissa) -> (Melissa ancestor of Jeffrey) -> (Abigail descendant of Jeffrey) -> (Abigail ancestor of Albert) -> (Sandra descendant of Albert) -> (Rachel descendant of Sandra) -> (Justin descendant of Rachel) -> (Teresa descendant of Justin) -> (Teresa ancestor of Janet) -> (Arthur descendant of Janet) -> (Arthur ancestor of Amanda) -> (Lawrence descendant of Amanda) -> (Alice descendant of Lawrence) -> (Megan descendant of Alice) -> (Megan ancestor of Alan) -> (Alan ancestor of Cynthia) -> (Samantha descendant of Cynthia) -> (Samantha ancestor of Beverly) -> (Robert descendant of Beverly) -> (Brandon descendant of Robert).\n\nThus we have a long chain connecting Elijah to Brandon via many links. Let's verify direction: Starting from Elijah (ancestor) -> Harold -> Michael -> Bobby (descendant of Michael) -> Philip (Bobby ancestor of Philip) -> Ralph descendant of Philip -> Karen ancestor of Ralph? Wait statement: Ralph is Karen's ancestor. Means Ralph ancestor of Karen. So chain: Ralph ancestor of Karen. So from Philip -> Ralph (descendant) -> Karen (descendant of Ralph). Actually if Ralph is Karen's ancestor, then Karen is descendant of Ralph. So chain: Philip -> Ralph (descendant) -> Karen (descendant). Then Karen ancestor of Denise (40) => Denise descendant of Karen. Denise ancestor of Patricia (60) => Patricia descendant of Denise. Patricia ancestor of Mason (51) => Mason descendant of Patricia. Diana descendant of Mason (15) => Diana descendant. Amy descendant of Diana (46) => Amy descendant. Amy ancestor of Gabriel (52) => Gabriel descendant of Amy.

Samantha descendant of Cynthia (3) => Samantha descendant. Samantha ancestor of Beverly (2) => Beverly descendant of Samantha. Robert descendant of Beverly (16) => Robert descendant. Brandon descendant of Robert (32) => Brandon descendant.\n\nThus we have a chain from Elijah down to Brandon (Elijah is ancestor of Brandon). Let's verify direction: Elijah -> Harold -> Michael -> Bobby -> Philip -> Ralph -> Karen -> Denise -> Patricia -> Mason -> Diana -> Amy -> Gabriel -> Dorothy -> Andrea -> Mary -> Kathleen -> Brian -> Madison -> Pamela -> Kevin -> William -> Tyler -> Carl -> Danielle -> Brenda -> Heather -> Jerry -> Ruth -> Mark -> Logan -> George -> Vincent -> Margaret -> Zachary -> Kelly -> Jennifer -> Richard -> Bryan -> Ryan -> Christine -> Janice -> Stephen -> Charles -> Melissa -> Jeffrey -> Abigail -> Albert -> Sandra -> Rachel -> Justin -> Teresa -> Janet -> Arthur -> Amanda -> Lawrence -> Alice -> Megan -> Alan -> Cynthia -> Samantha -> Beverly -> Robert -> Brandon.\n\nAll links are consistent with ancestor/descendant statements?

Also we have Robert descendant of Beverly (16). So chain: Beverly -> Robert -> Brandon (Beverly ancestor of Robert, Robert ancestor of Brandon). Also we have Samantha ancestor of Beverly (2). So Samantha -> Beverly -> Robert -> Brandon.\n\nAlso we have other connections maybe linking to Elijah.\n\nElijah ancestor of Harold (24). Harold ancestor of Michael (39).

Wait: Alan ancestor of Cynthia, so Cynthia descendant of Alan. Samantha descendant of Cynthia, so Samantha descendant of Alan as well. Also Samantha ancestor of Beverly (2). So chain: Alan -> Cynthia -> Samantha -> Beverly -> Robert -> Brandon.\n\nNow we have Elijah chain: Elijah ancestor of Harold -> Michael -> (Bobby descendant of Michael) -> (Bobby ancestor of Philip) -> (Ralph descendant of Philip) -> (Ralph ancestor of Karen) -> (Karen ancestor of Denise) -> (Denise ancestor of Patricia) -> (Patricia ancestor of Mason) -> (Diana descendant of Mason) -> (Amy descendant of Diana) -> (Amy ancestor of Gabriel) -> (Gabriel ancestor of Dorothy) -> (Dorothy ancestor of Andrea) -> (Mary descendant of Andrea) -> (Kathleen descendant of Mary) -> (Brian descendant of Kathleen) -> (Brian ancestor of Madison) -> (Madison ancestor of Pamela) -> (Kevin descendant of Pamela) -> (Kevin ancestor of William) -> (Tyler descendant of William) -> (Tyler ancestor of Carl) -> (Danielle descendant of Carl) -> (Brenda descendant of Danielle) -> (Heather descendant of Brenda) -> (Jerry descendant of Heather) -> (Jerry ancestor of Ruth) -> (Ruth ancestor of Mark) -> (Logan descendant of Mark) -> (Logan ancestor of George) -> (Vincent descendant of George) -> (Vincent ancestor of Margaret) -> (Zachary descendant of Margaret) -> (Zachary ancestor of Kelly) -> (Jennifer descendant of Kelly) -> (Richard descendant of Jennifer) -> (Richard ancestor of Bryan) -> (Ryan descendant of Bryan) -> (Christine descendant of Ryan) -> (Christine ancestor of Janice) -> (Stephen descendant of Janice) -> (Stephen ancestor of Charles) -> (Charles ancestor of Melissa) -> (Melissa ancestor of Jeffrey) -> (Abigail descendant of Jeffrey) -> (Abigail ancestor of Albert) -> (Sandra descendant of Albert) -> (Rachel descendant of Sandra) -> (Justin descendant of Rachel) -> (Teresa descendant of Justin) -> (Teresa ancestor of Janet) -> (Arthur descendant of Janet) -> (Arthur ancestor of Amanda) -> (Lawrence descendant of Amanda) -> (Alice descendant of Lawrence) -> (Megan descendant of Alice) -> (Megan ancestor of Alan) -> (Alan ancestor of Cynthia) -> (Samantha descendant of Cynthia) -> (Samantha ancestor of Beverly) -> (Robert descendant of Beverly) -> (Brandon descendant of Robert).\n\nThus we have a long chain connecting Elijah to Brandon via many links.
