Also David -> Justin (David ancestor of Justin). So David -> Justin -> Beverly. Also maybe others connect.\n\nGerald's descendant chain: Gerald -> Emma (since Gerald ancestor of Emma). Also Emma is Rachel's ancestor (Emma -> Rachel). Rachel -> Michael (Rachel -> Michael). Michael -> Lauren (Michael -> Lauren). Also Lauren is Doris's ancestor (Lauren -> Doris). Also Doris -> Anna (Doris -> Anna). Also Anna -> Kelly (Anna -> Kelly). Also Kelly -> Alexis (Kelly -> Alexis). Also Alexis -> Stephanie (Alexis -> Stephanie).

Catherine -> Heather (Catherine -> Heather). Heather -> Christine (Heather -> Christine). Christine -> Roger (Christine -> Roger). Roger -> David (Roger -> David). David -> Justin (David -> Justin). Justin -> Beverly (Justin -> Beverly). So we have a long chain connecting Gerald to Beverly via many steps! Let's verify direction: Starting from Gerald, we go down to Emma (descendant). Then Emma -> Rachel (since Emma is Rachel's ancestor). So Emma ancestor of Rachel, meaning edge Emma -> Rachel. So chain: Gerald -> Emma -> Rachel -> Michael -> Lauren -> Doris -> Anna -> Kelly -> Alexis -> Stephanie -> Deborah -> Andrea -> Bobby -> Kimberly -> Cynthia -> Henry -> John -> Scott -> Andrew -> Kyle -> Madison -> Barbara -> Robert -> Matthew -> Joshua -> Thomas -> Brenda -> Donald -> Jean -> Nicole -> Jack -> Ann -> Samantha -> Stephen -> Sara -> Randy -> Alexander -> Emily -> Abigail -> Hannah -> Dorothy -> Keith -> Albert -> Kathryn -> Jacqueline -> Katherine -> Sharon -> Jeremy -> Carolyn -> Bradley -> Peter -> Alan -> Tyler -> Brandon -> Lawrence -> Susan -> Grace -> Catherine -> Heather -> Christine -> Roger -> David -> Justin -> Beverly.\n\nThus Gerald is ancestor of Beverly (since chain from Gerald down to Beverly).
