Brittany -> Joan? Wait we have Brittany is Joan's ancestor (14) => Brittany -> Joan. Also Joan -> Donald (42). Donald -> Kayla (8). Kayla -> Vincent (44). Vincent -> Megan (45). Megan -> Brandon (40). Brandon -> Jean (52). Jean -> Pamela (13). Pamela -> Edward (39). Edward -> Nicholas (58). Nicholas -> Stephanie (5). Stephanie -> Kyle?

Bradley -> Judith (37). Judith -> David (4). David -> Janet (33). Janet -> Ethan (17). Ethan -> Christina (62). Christina -> Steven (28). So we have a long chain from Kathryn down to Steven!
