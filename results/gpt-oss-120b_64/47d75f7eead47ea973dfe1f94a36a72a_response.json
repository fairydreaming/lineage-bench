So chain: Cheryl -> Jennifer -> Beverly.\n\nAlso we have Beverly -> Deborah (1) -> Charlotte (8) -> Alice (30) -> Gregory (57) -> Diana (51) -> ... also Gregory -> Diana (51) means Gregory ancestor of Diana. Wait we have Gregory is Diana's ancestor (51) => Gregory -> Diana. So chain: Alice -> Gregory -> Diana. Also Diana -> George (4) (since George is Diana's descendant). So Diana -> George. Then George -> Michael (44) (George is Michael's ancestor). So George -> Michael. Michael -> Marilyn (28) (Michael ancestor of Marilyn). Marilyn -> Matthew (21). Matthew -> Madison (20). Also we have Madison -> Katherine (58). Also Katherine -> Sandra (32). Sandra -> Joshua (2). Joshua -> Judith (13). Also Judith -> Donna (52). Donna -> Theresa (48). Theresa -> Raymond (53).

So Peter is descendant of Cheryl. Therefore relationship: Peter is Cheryl's descendant (option 4). Let's verify no contradictory statements that could create alternative relationship like common ancestor etc. But we have a clear ancestor chain.\n\nThus answer 4.\n\nCheck if any other path could make Cheryl descendant of Peter?
