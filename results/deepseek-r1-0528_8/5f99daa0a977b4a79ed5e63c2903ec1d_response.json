Frances is Heather's descendant.\n\n6. Alexis is Eugene's descendant.\n\n7. Frances is William's ancestor.\n\nI should sketch out a family tree or find connections.\n\nStart with Doris and Maria. Since Doris is Maria's ancestor, that means Doris comes before Maria in the lineage. For example, Doris could be Maria's parent, grandparent, etc.\n\nSimilarly, Bradley is Maria's descendant, so Bradley comes after Maria; Bradley could be Maria's child, grandchild, etc.\n\nAlso, Doris is William's descendant. So Doris descends from William, meaning William is an ancestor of Doris.\n\nFrances is William's ancestor, so Frances comes before William.\n\nNow, Alexis is Heather's ancestor, and Frances is Heather's descendant. Frances is Heather's descendant? Let me read that again.\n\nStatement 5: Frances is Heather's descendant. That means Heather is an ancestor of Frances.\n\nSimilarly, Alexis is Eugene's descendant, so Eugene is an ancestor of Alexis? No.\n\nStatement 6: Alexis is Eugene's descendant. So Alexis descends from Eugene, meaning Eugene is an ancestor of Alexis.\n\nLet me clarify the terminology:\n\n- If A is B's ancestor, then A comes before B, and B is A's descendant.\n\n- If A is B's descendant, then A comes after B, and B is A's ancestor.\n\nSo:\n\n- Doris is Maria's ancestor: Doris → ... → Maria\n\n- Bradley is Maria's descendant: Maria → ... → Bradley\n\n- Alexis is Heather's ancestor: Alexis → ... → Heather\n\n- Doris is William's descendant: William → ... → Doris\n\n- Frances is Heather's descendant: Heather → ... → Frances\n\n- Alexis is Eugene's descendant: Eugene → ... → Alexis\n\n- Frances is William's ancestor: Frances → ... → William\n\nNow, I need to connect these to find how Eugene and Bradley are related.\n\nLet me list the relationships in terms of who is before whom.\n\nFrom Doris and Maria:\n\nDoris is ancestor to Maria: Doris → Maria\n\nBradley is descendant of Maria: so Maria → Bradley, thus Doris → Maria → Bradley\n\nDoris is descendant of William: William → Doris\n\nSo William → Doris → Maria → Bradley\n\nNow, Frances is ancestor of William: Frances → William\n\nSo Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley\n\nNow, Alexis and Heather.\n\nAlexis is ancestor of Heather: Alexis → Heather\n\nFrances is descendant of Heather: Heather → Frances\n\nSince Frances is descendant of Heather, and Heather is descendant of Alexis, so Alexis → Heather → Frances\n\nBut we also have Frances → William from above.\n\nSo Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley\n\nNow, Alexis is descendant of Eugene: Eugene → Alexis\n\nSo Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley\n\nTherefore, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley, because there's a direct line: Eugene to Alexis to Heather to Frances to William to Doris to Maria to Bradley.\n\nSo Eugene is Bradley's ancestor.\n\nBut let me double-check if all connections are consistent.\n\nList the chain:\n\n- Eugene → Alexis (since Alexis is Eugene's descendant)\n\n- Alexis → Heather (Alexis is Heather's ancestor)\n\n- Heather → Frances (Frances is Heather's descendant)\n\n- Frances → William (Frances is William's ancestor)\n\n- William → Doris (Doris is William's descendant)\n\n- Doris → Maria (Doris is Maria's ancestor)\n\n- Maria → Bradley (Bradley is Maria's descendant)\n\nYes, so Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley\n\nTherefore, Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley.\n\nNow, the question is about the relationship between Eugene and Bradley.\n\nOption 1: Eugene is Bradley's ancestor. That seems correct based on this.\n\nBut let me see if there are any contradictions or other possibilities.\n\nIs there any statement that might conflict?\n\nFor example, are there any other relationships given that I haven't considered?\n\nThe statements are all used: I used 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nDoris is Maria's ancestor: used.\n\nBradley is Maria's descendant: used.\n\nAlexis is Heather's ancestor: used.\n\nDoris is William's descendant: used.\n\nFrances is Heather's descendant: used.\n\nAlexis is Eugene's descendant: used.\n\nFrances is William's ancestor: used.\n\nAll seem consistent.\n\nCould there be multiple lineages? But the way it's connected, it seems direct.\n\nPerhaps Eugene and Bradley share a common ancestor, but in this case, Eugene is directly an ancestor, so it's more specific.\n\nOption 2 is \"Eugene and Bradley share a common ancestor.\" But since Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley, they do share a common ancestor—Eugene himself, or others—but it's not the best answer because it's more direct.\n\nThe question is to determine the relationship, and option 1 is more precise.\n\nOption 3: Eugene is Bradley's descendant. That would be the opposite, which isn't true based on the chain.\n\nOption 4: They share a common descendant. That might be possible, but in this chain, Bradley is a descendant of both, but Eugene is ancestor, so Bradley is descendant of Eugene, so they don't share a common descendant; Bradley is the descendant.\n\nSharing a common descendant means that there is some person who is a descendant of both Eugene and Bradley, but since Eugene is ancestor of Bradley, any descendant of Bradley is also a descendant of Eugene, but that means Eugene has all descendants that Bradley has, so they don't share a common descendant in the sense of someone else; it's that Bradley is the point.\n\nTypically, \"share a common descendant\" means there is some third person C who is descendant of both A and B.\n\nBut if A is ancestor of B, then any descendant of B is also descendant of A, so C would be descendant of A automatically if descendant of B, so it might not be considered \"sharing\" in that way, but technically, they do have common descendants, like Bradley himself or further.\n\nBut option 4 says \"share a common descendant,\" which could be true, but it's not specific to the relationship; it's a weaker statement.\n\nFor example, if two people have a common descendant, it means they are both ancestors of that person.\n\nBut in this case, since Eugene is ancestor of Bradley, Eugene and Bradley both have Bradley as a descendant, or any of Bradley's descendants.\n\nBut option 1 is stronger and directly states the relationship.\n\nMoreover, in multiple choice, if 1 is true, we should select that.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason why Eugene might not be Bradley's ancestor.\n\nPerhaps the chain has issues.\n\nAnother thing: statement 6 says Alexis is Eugene's descendant, so Eugene → Alexis.\n\nAnd Alexis is Heather's ancestor, so Alexis → Heather.\n\nThen Heather → Frances, since Frances is Heather's descendant.\n\nFrances → William, since Frances is William's ancestor.\n\nWilliam → Doris, since Doris is William's descendant.\n\nDoris → Maria.\n\nMaria → Bradley.\n\nSo yes, Eugene to Bradley is clear.\n\nPerhaps I should assign generations or something to verify.\n\nAssume Eugene is generation 0.\n\nThen Alexis is his descendant, so generation 1.\n\nHeather is descendant of Alexis, so generation 2.\n\nFrances is descendant of Heather, so generation 3.\n\nWilliam is descendant of Frances? No.\n\nFrances is William's ancestor, so Frances → William, so William is descendant of Frances.\n\nSince Frances is gen 3, William is gen 4.\n\nDoris is William's descendant, so William → Doris, Doris is gen 5.\n\nMaria is Doris's descendant? Doris is Maria's ancestor, so Doris → Maria, Maria is gen 6.\n\nBradley is Maria's descendant, so Maria → Bradley, Bradley is gen 7.\n\nSo Eugene gen 0, Bradley gen 7, so Eugene is ancestor.\n\nIf I start from Bradley.\n\nBradley is Maria's descendant, Maria is Doris's descendant, Doris is William's descendant, William is Frances's descendant, Frances is Heather's descendant, Heather is Alexis's descendant, Alexis is Eugene's descendant. So yes.\n\nNow, is there any loop or contradiction?\n\nFor example, Doris is William's descendant and William is Frances's descendant, but Frances is Heather's descendant, and Heather is Alexis's descendant, who is Eugene's descendant.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there are multiple paths, but in this case, it's a single chain.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify that there are no other relationships, but based on given, this seems the only connection.\n\nTherefore, Eugene is Bradley's ancestor.\n\nSo option 1 should be correct.\n\nBut let me look at the options again.\n\n1. Eugene is Bradley's ancestor.\n\n2. Eugene and Bradley share a common ancestor.\n\n3. Eugene is Bradley's descendant.\n\n4. Eugene and Bradley share a common descendant.\n\n5. None of the above.\n\nNow, 2 is true because they share common ancestors, like Eugene himself, or further back, but since Eugene is the starting point in the chain, but there could be others, but it's vague.\n\nSimilarly, 4: they share common descendants, like Bradley or his children.\n\nBut 1 is directly stated and true.\n\nIn fact, if 1 is true, then 2 is automatically true, but we should pick the most specific answer.\n\nSince the question is to determine the lineage relationship, and 1 defines it precisely.\n\nMoreover, in such problems, if a direct ancestor-descendant relationship exists, we should choose that.\n\nOption 3 is false.\n\nOption 4: do they share a common descendant?\n\nFor example, is there someone who is a descendant of both Eugene and Bradley?\n\nSince Eugene is ancestor of Bradley, Bradley is a descendant of both? No.\n\nBradley is descendant of Eugene, but Eugene is not descendant of Bradley.\n\nSo for Bradley to be a common descendant, that would require that both Eugene and Bradley are ancestors of Bradley, which is tautological, but Eugene is ancestor, Bradley is descendant, so Bradley is not an ancestor of himself.\n\nTypically, \"descendant\" implies a different person.\n\nSo common descendant C, such that C is descendant of Eugene and C is descendant of Bradley.\n\nSince Eugene is ancestor of Bradley, any descendant of Bradley is also descendant of Eugene, so for example, Bradley's child would be descendant of both, so they do share common descendants.\n\nSimilarly, Bradley himself might not be considered, but his descendants are.\n\nSo option 4 is also true.\n\nBut that makes it confusing.\n\nFor instance, let C be a child of Bradley. Then C is descendant of Bradley, and since Bradley is descendant of Eugene, C is also descendant of Eugene. So yes, C is a common descendant of Eugene and Bradley.\n\nTherefore, both 1 and 4 could be argued, but 4 is weaker.\n\nSimilarly, 2 is also true because they share common ancestors; for example, Eugene is a common ancestor, or if there were others.\n\nBut the direct relationship is ancestor.\n\nIn multiple choice, since 1 is listed and it's precise, I think it's the best answer.\n\nMoreover, the problem likely expects 1.\n\nPerhaps I misread the statements.\n\nAnother point: statement 4: Doris is William's descendant, which I have as William → Doris.\n\nBut William could be parent, grandparent, etc.\n\nSimilarly, Frances is William's ancestor, so Frances → William.\n\nIn my chain, Frances → William → Doris, which is fine.\n\nIs there any indication that William is directly related or something?\n\nNo, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps Eugene and Bradley are the same person, but that doesn't make sense because the chain has multiple steps.\n\nFor example, from Eugene to Bradley, there are several generations, so different people.\n\nSo Eugene cannot be Bradley.\n\nTherefore, I think option 1 is correct.\n\nBut let me see the answer choices; perhaps I should consider if \"none of the above\" but I think 1 is correct.\n\nMaybe I have the direction wrong.\n\nStatement 6: Alexis is Eugene's descendant. So Eugene → Alexis.\n\nBut in the chain, Alexis is before Heather, who is before Frances, who is before William, etc., down to Bradley.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps Frances being William's ancestor and Doris being William's descendant might imply that Doris and William are different, but that's fine.\n\nI think it's consistent.\n\nPerhaps the common ancestor part.\n\nAnother thought: do Eugene and Bradley share a common ancestor besides Eugene?\n\nFor example, Eugene might have ancestors, but not given, so we don't know.\n\nBut option 2 says they share a common ancestor, which is true, Eugene is one, or others if exist.\n\nBut again, not as specific.\n\nSimilarly for descendant.\n\nI think for the purpose, option 1 is what the problem wants.\n\nPerhaps I should check if Bradley is descendant of Eugene directly.\n\nIn the chain, yes.\n\nMaybe through multiple paths, but only one given.\n\nI think I should go with 1.\n\nSo the answer should be 1.\n","reasoning_details":[{"format":null,"index":0,"type":"reasoning.text","text":"First, I need to figure out the lineage relationships between Eugene and Bradley based on the given statements.
