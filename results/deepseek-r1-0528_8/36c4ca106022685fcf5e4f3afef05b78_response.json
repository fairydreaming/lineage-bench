So, Ronald → Rachel (ancestor to descendant).\n\nFrom 6: Christina is Rachel's descendant. So, Rachel → Christina.\n\nChristina is Rachel's descendant, meaning Rachel is Christina's ancestor. So, Rachel → Christina.\n\nNow, from 3: Emily is Christina's descendant. So, Christina → Emily.\n\nFrom 5: John is Emily's descendant.

So, Pamela → Ronald.\n\nTherefore, we can extend the chain: Pamela → Ronald → Rachel → Christina → Emily → John.\n\nNow, let's look at Paul and Theresa.\n\nFrom 2: Theresa is Paul's descendant. So, Paul → Theresa.\n\nFrom 7: John is Paul's ancestor. So, John → Paul.\n\nJohn is Paul's ancestor, meaning Paul is John's descendant. So, John → Paul.\n\nThen, since Theresa is Paul's descendant, Paul → Theresa.\n\nSo, John → Paul → Theresa.\n\nNow, from the earlier chain, we have John at the end: Pamela → Ronald → Rachel → Christina → Emily → John.\n\nThen John → Paul → Theresa.\n\nSo, the full chain is: Pamela → Ronald → Rachel → Christina → Emily → John → Paul → Theresa.\n\nTherefore, Pamela is an ancestor of John, and John is an ancestor of Paul, and Paul is an ancestor of Theresa, so Pamela is an ancestor of Theresa.\n\nIn lineage terms, if A is ancestor of B, and B is ancestor of C, then A is ancestor of C.\n\nSo, Pamela → ... → Theresa.\n\nTherefore, Theresa is a descendant of Pamela.\n\nThe question is about the relationship between Theresa and Pamela.\n\nFrom this, Theresa is Pamela's descendant.\n\nNow, let me check if there are any contradictions.\n\nWe have all points covered:\n\n- Ronald is Rachel's ancestor: yes, in the chain.\n\n- Theresa is Paul's descendant: yes, Paul → Theresa.\n\n- Emily is Christina's descendant: yes, Christina → Emily.\n\n- Pamela is Ronald's ancestor: yes, Pamela → Ronald.\n\n- John is Emily's descendant: yes, Emily → John.\n\n- Christina is Rachel's descendant: yes, Rachel → Christina.\n\n- John is Paul's ancestor: yes, John → Paul.\n\nAll seem consistent.\n\nThe options are:\n\n1.

That would mean there is someone who is descendant of both, but in this linear chain, everyone below Pamela is descendant of Pamela, but Theresa and Pamela don't have a common descendant besides Theresa herself or below, but typically \"share a common descendant\" implies someone else who is descendant of both, which might imply branching, but here it's linear.\n\nIn a linear lineage, they don't share a common descendant; Pamela has descendants, and Theresa is one, but \"share\" might imply both are ancestors of someone, but Pamela is ancestor, Theresa is descendant, so they don't both have a common descendant.\n\nSimilarly, for common ancestor: they do have common ancestors, like Pamela is an ancestor of both, but Theresa and Pamela, Pamela is her own ancestor?

No: \"Theresa is Paul's descendant\" means Paul is ancestor of Theresa, so Paul → Theresa.\n\nSimilarly, \"Emily is Christina's descendant\" means Christina → Emily.\n\n\"John is Emily's descendant\" means Emily → John.\n\n\"Christina is Rachel's descendant\" means Rachel → Christina.\n\n\"John is Paul's ancestor\" means John → Paul.\n\n\"Pamela is Ronald's ancestor\" means Pamela → Ronald.\n\nSo:\n\nPamela → Ronald (4)\n\nRonald → Rachel (1)\n\nRachel → Christina (6)\n\nChristina → Emily (3)\n\nEmily → John (5)\n\nJohn → Paul (7)\n\nPaul → Theresa (2)\n\nSo: Pamela → Ronald → Rachel → Christina → Emily → John → Paul → Theresa\n\nThus, Pamela → Theresa, so Theresa is descendant of Pamela.\n\nTherefore, option 1: Theresa is Pamela's descendant.\n\nNow, is there any possibility of ambiguity?\n\nFor example, could \"descendant\" include self or something?
