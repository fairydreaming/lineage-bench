Sarah connects through a separate path: Sarah -> Jennifer -> Ronald -> Roger -> Jesse -> Julie -> Billy -> Patrick -> Rachel. Both Tyler and Sarah have Rachel as a descendant, making Rachel a common descendant of multiple ancestral lines.

Since both Tyler and Sarah have Rachel as their descendant, they share her as a common descendant.\n\nBut I should verify whether Sarah and Tyler have a direct relationship or share a common ancestor. Looking more carefully at the chains, they don't intersect until Rachel. However, I notice \"Sara\" appears in Tyler's lineage while we're tracking \"Sarah\" in the other chain. These might be the same person, which would change the relationship entirely.\n\nAfter checking the clues, Sarah and Sara are actually different people. So I have two distinct paths converging at Rachel: one through Sarah and one through Tyler. Neither appears to be an ancestor of the other, and there's no common ancestor mentioned in the problem.

The chain extends from Hannah through Jeffrey, Andrew, Walter, and Martha, then branches through Carl, Paul, and Kayla down to Jason, Wayne, and Olivia. The line continues through Evelyn, Ashley, and Keith, eventually reaching Albert, Arthur, Ralph, and Donald.

Since both Tyler and Sarah have Rachel as their descendant, they share her as a common descendant.\n\nBut I should verify whether Sarah and Tyler have a direct relationship or share a common ancestor. Looking more carefully at the chains, they don't intersect until Rachel. However, I notice \"Sara\" appears in Tyler's lineage while we're tracking \"Sarah\" in the other chain. These might be the same person, which would change the relationship entirely.\n\nAfter checking the clues, Sarah and Sara are actually different people. So I have two distinct paths converging at Rachel: one through Sarah and one through Tyler. Neither appears to be an ancestor of the other, and there's no common ancestor mentioned in the problem. This means Sarah and Tyler's only connection is their shared descendant, Rachel.","signature":"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
