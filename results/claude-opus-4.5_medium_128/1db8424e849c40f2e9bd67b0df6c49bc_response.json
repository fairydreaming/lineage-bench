Gabriel is ancestor of Russell, and Russell is Janet's ancestor, so I can trace Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene. Eugene is Joe's ancestor, so I can continue building this chain.\n\nFollowing the descendant relationships: Joe has Alexis as a descendant, Alexis has Ronald as a descendant, and Ronald is Dorothy's ancestor. From Dorothy, Diana is a descendant, and Abigail is Diana's descendant. Since Abigail is Sara's ancestor, I can extend the path all the way through: Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara.\n\nContinuing from Sara: she's an ancestor of Jose, who has Albert as a descendant. Albert then has Sharon as a descendant, and Sharon is an ancestor of Laura. Finally, Teresa is Laura's descendant, completing the full lineage from Gabriel through Teresa.\n\nFrom there, Danielle descends from Teresa, making Danielle an ancestor of Gregory. Gregory himself is an ancestor of Lauren, extending the chain all the way to: Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren.\n\nJordan descends from Lauren, so the lineage continues through Jordan. Roy then descends from Jordan, followed by Nancy descending from Roy. Aaron descends from Nancy, and Denise descends from Aaron. Judith is a descendant of Denise, Joshua descends from Judith, and Pamela descends from Joshua, completing the full ancestral line: Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela.\n\nContinuing forward, Nathan descends from Pamela, Dylan descends from Nathan, and Terry is Dylan's descendant. Matthew descends from Terry, Brittany descends from Matthew, and Jennifer descends from Brittany. Douglas is Jennifer's descendant, extending the chain further down the generations.\n\nChristina descends from Douglas, George descends from Christina, and Catherine descends from George. Timothy is Catherine's descendant, Olivia descends from Timothy, and Julia descends from Olivia. Sean is Julia's descendant, and Andrew is Sean's descendant, continuing the lineage from Gabriel through all these generations.\n\nCarolyn descends from Andrew, Emma is Carolyn's descendant, and Amanda descends from Emma. Karen is Amanda's descendant, Adam is Karen's descendant, and Elijah descends from Adam. Ann is Elijah's descendant, with Jesse being Ann's descendant, extending the chain further: Gabriel → ... → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse.\n\nContinuing forward, Cynthia descends from Jesse, Martha from Cynthia, and Lisa from Martha. Nicole is Lisa's descendant, Bruce descends from Nicole, Sophia from Bruce, and Susan from Sophia. Cheryl is Susan's descendant, completing the lineage: Gabriel → ... → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl.\n\nFrom there, Christian descends from Cheryl, Kathleen from Christian, Kimberly from Kathleen, and Raymond from Kimberly. David is Raymond's descendant, Angela descends from David, and Jack from Angela. The full chain extends: Gabriel → ... → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack.\n\nContinuing forward, Charlotte descends from Jack, Beverly from Charlotte, and Michelle from Beverly. Austin is Michelle's descendant, Frances from Austin, Donald from Frances, Debra from Donald, and finally Janice from Debra. This gives us: Gabriel → ... → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice.\n\nKyle descends from Janice, Paul from Kyle, and Jacob from Paul. Jacob is an ancestor of Diane, who is an ancestor of Bobby, who is an ancestor of Willie, who is an ancestor of Bradley, who is an ancestor of Scott. Sarah is Scott's descendant, extending the line: Gabriel → ... → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → Bradley → Scott → Sarah.\n\nContinuing forward, Scott is an ancestor of Sarah, who is an ancestor of Henry. Henry is an ancestor of Marilyn, Marilyn of Benjamin, and Benjamin of Jacqueline. Jacqueline is an ancestor of Helen, Helen of Thomas, and Thomas of Marie. This gives us: Gabriel → ... → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie.\n\nMarie is Jason, so Jason follows in the line. Jason is an ancestor of Emily, Emily of Ashley, and Ashley of Jonathan. Jonathan is an ancestor of Barbara, Barbara of Larry, and Larry of Doris. Doris is an ancestor of Kenneth, and Kenneth of Nicholas. The complete chain extends: Gabriel → ... → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas.\n\nNicholas is Carol's ancestor, placing Carol after Nicholas in the sequence. Carol is an ancestor of Maria, so Maria follows Carol. The extended line now reads: Gabriel → ... → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria.\n\nShirley is Deborah's descendant, making Deborah an ancestor of Shirley. However, these two don't connect directly to the main chain yet. Looking at the relationships involving Eugene: Eugene is Joe's ancestor and Eugene is Janet's descendant, meaning Janet → Eugene → Joe. I need to determine how Eugene's line connects to the rest of the family tree.\n\nTo locate Joan, I can trace backward from her known connections. William is Joan's ancestor, so William → Joan. Brian connects to William as his ancestor, creating Brian → William → Joan. Continuing this pattern upward: Gerald → Brian → William → Joan, then Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan, then Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan. Following the chain further back, Mason is Eric's ancestor, and Judy is Mason's ancestor, extending the line to Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan.\n\nMoving further up the family tree, Betty connects as Judy's ancestor, followed by Christine as Betty's ancestor, then Natalie as Christine's ancestor. Anna is Natalie's ancestor, and Linda is Anna's ancestor. Ruth connects to Linda as her ancestor, giving me Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan.\n\nContinuing backward, Virginia is Ruth's ancestor, Carl is Virginia's ancestor, and Jeremy is Carl's ancestor. This extends the chain to Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan. Theresa appears to be Jeremy's ancestor, though the connection is still being traced.\n\nMoving further back, Brandon connects as Theresa's ancestor, Gary as Brandon's ancestor, Michael as Gary's ancestor, and Evelyn as Michael's ancestor. The lineage continues: Evelyn → Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth and down to Joan. Melissa connects as Evelyn's ancestor, extending the chain even further back.\n\nFrom Melissa, Mark is her ancestor, Philip is Mark's ancestor, and Shirley is Philip's ancestor. This creates the extended lineage: Shirley → Philip → Mark → Melissa → Evelyn → Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → ... → Joan. Now examining Deborah's connections to see if she fits as Shirley's ancestor in this chain.\n\nGabriel doesn't appear to connect directly to Deborah through the relationships I've identified. Let me trace forward from Gabriel instead. Gabriel connects to Russell, who connects to Janet, and Janet connects to Eugene. From Eugene, the line continues through Joe to Alexis. I need to verify these connections more carefully—particularly whether Eugene descends from Janet, and whether this chain eventually reaches the Joan lineage.\n\nFollowing the path: Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana. This extended chain shows how Gabriel's line progresses through multiple generations, though I still need to determine if it intersects with either Deborah or Joan.\n\nLet me trace backward from Judy to see if there's a connection to Gabriel. Working through the ancestors: Betty → Judy, Christine → Betty, Natalie → Christine, and Linda → Anna → Natalie. Ruth appears as Linda's ancestor, which means Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy. Now I need to check whether Gabriel's line connects to Ruth.\n\nCarl is Virginia's ancestor, so Carl → Virginia → Ruth. This extends the chain: Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan.\n\nNow I'm checking if Gabriel connects to Carl. Carl descends from Jeremy, who descends from Theresa. Brandon is Theresa's ancestor, and tracing further back: Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl. Michael is Gary's ancestor, Evelyn is Michael's ancestor, and Melissa is Evelyn's ancestor. So the line continues: Melissa → Evelyn → Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl.\n\nFollowing this further, Mark is Melissa's ancestor, Philip is Mark's ancestor, and Shirley is Philip's ancestor. This gives me: Shirley → Philip → Mark → Melissa → Evelyn → ... → Carl. Deborah is Shirley's ancestor, extending the chain back to: Deborah → Shirley → Philip → Mark → Melissa → Evelyn → ... → Carl.\n\nNow I need to determine if Gabriel connects to Deborah. Looking at Deborah's connections, Shirley is her descendant, but I don't see other direct links. Let me explore another direction—checking what Joan connects to going upward through her ancestors, starting with Joan ← William ← Brian.\n\nSince Brian is Gerald's descendant and William's ancestor, I can trace: Gerald → Brian → William → Joan. Continuing backward, Stephen is Gerald's ancestor and Eric is Stephen's ancestor, so: Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan. Mason is Eric's descendant and Judy is Mason's descendant, giving me: Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan.\n\nWorking further back, Betty is Judy's ancestor and Christine is Betty's ancestor, so: Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan. Natalie is Christine's ancestor and Anna is Natalie's ancestor, extending the chain to: Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan.\n\nI need to continue tracing Anna's ancestors to complete the full lineage. Carl is Jeremy's descendant (Jeremy → Carl).\n\nThe chain extends: Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan\n\nTracing Jeremy back, Theresa is his ancestor (Theresa → Jeremy). Brandon precedes Theresa in the line (Brandon → Theresa). Gary is Brandon's ancestor (Gary → Brandon), and Michael is Gary's ancestor (Michael → Gary).\n\nThe full sequence now reads: Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan\n\nContinuing backward from Michael: Evelyn is his ancestor (Evelyn → Michael), Melissa precedes Evelyn (Melissa → Evelyn), Mark is Melissa's ancestor (Mark → Melissa), Philip is Mark's ancestor (Philip → Mark), and Shirley precedes Philip (Shirley → Philip).\n\nThe complete lineage is: Shirley → Philip → Mark → Melissa → Evelyn → Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan\n\nNow tracing back from Shirley: Deborah is her ancestor (Deborah → Shirley). Looking further, I notice Deborah is Maria's descendant, and Maria descends from Carol. So the full chain extends: Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → Philip → Mark → Melissa → Evelyn → Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan\n\n.\n\nContinuing backward, Carol has an ancestor in Nicholas (Nicholas → Carol), making the line: Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Kenneth is Nicholas's ancestor (Kenneth → Nicholas), so: Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. And Doris is Kenneth's ancestor (Doris → Kenneth), extending it further: Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nMoving further back, Larry is Doris's ancestor (Larry → Doris), so: Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Barbara is Larry's ancestor (Barbara → Larry), giving: Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Jonathan is Barbara's ancestor (Jonathan → Barbara), so: Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Ashley is Jonathan's ancestor (Ashley → Jonathan), so: Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Finally, Emily is Ashley's ancestor (Emily → Ashley), making the full line: Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nContinuing backward, Jason is Emily's ancestor (Jason → Emily), so: Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Marie is Jason's ancestor (Marie → Jason), so: Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Thomas is Marie's ancestor (Thomas → Marie), so: Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Helen is Thomas's ancestor (Helen → Thomas), so: Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nJacqueline is Helen's ancestor (Jacqueline → Helen), so: Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Benjamin is Jacqueline's ancestor (Benjamin → Jacqueline), so: Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Marilyn is Benjamin's ancestor (Marilyn → Benjamin), so: Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nHenry is Marilyn's ancestor (Henry → Marilyn), so: Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Sarah is Henry's ancestor (Sarah → Henry), so: Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nScott is Sarah's ancestor (Scott → Sarah), so: Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Bradley is Scott's ancestor (Bradley → Scott), so: Bradley → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Willie is Bradley's ancestor (Willie → Bradley), so: Willie → Bradley → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason.\n\nContinuing the chain, Bobby is Willie's ancestor (Bobby → Willie), so: Bobby → Willie → Bradley → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Diane is Bobby's ancestor (Diane → Bobby), so: Diane → Bobby → Willie → Bradley → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nJacob is Diane's ancestor (Jacob → Diane), so: Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → Bradley → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → ... → Joan.\n\nI still need to find where Gabriel connects. Gabriel → Russell → Janet, and Janet has Eugene as a descendant (Janet → Eugene). From Eugene, Joe is a descendant (Eugene → Joe), and from Joe, Alexis is a descendant (Joe → Alexis). From Alexis, Ronald is a descendant (Alexis → Ronald).\n\nRonald is Dorothy's ancestor (Ronald → Dorothy), so: Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy. From Dorothy, Diana is a descendant (Dorothy → Diana), and from Diana, Abigail is a descendant (Diana → Abigail).\n\nThe Gabriel chain doesn't seem to connect to Joan's chain yet. I should check if there's a common ancestor linking them. Looking back at Jacob—Paul is Jacob's ancestor (Paul → Jacob), so there might be a connection through Paul.\n\nTracing Paul's lineage: Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Kyle connects to Paul, and Janice is Kyle's ancestor (Janice → Kyle). Following further back: Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Debra is Janice's ancestor, and Donald appears to be Debra's ancestor, so I need to continue tracing Donald to see if this chain eventually connects to Gabriel's line.\n\nWorking backward through the ancestry: Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Frances is Donald's ancestor, then Austin is Frances's ancestor, and Michelle is Austin's ancestor. Beverly is Michelle's ancestor, and Charlotte is Beverly's ancestor. The chain now extends: Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nContinuing further back, Jack is Charlotte's ancestor, Angela is Jack's ancestor, and David is Angela's ancestor. This extends the lineage to: David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nRaymond is David's ancestor, making the chain: Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nKimberly is Raymond's ancestor, and Kathleen is Kimberly's ancestor, extending the full lineage back to: Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nChristian is Kathleen's ancestor, and Cheryl is Christian's ancestor, pushing the chain further back: Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nSusan is Cheryl's ancestor, so the complete lineage traces back to Susan at the beginning of this ancestral chain.\n\nSophia is Susan's ancestor, and Bruce is Sophia's ancestor, extending the full lineage to: Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nNicole is Bruce's ancestor, and Lisa is Nicole's ancestor, which means the chain continues further back: Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nMartha appears to be connected to Lisa in this genealogical sequence. Jesse is Cynthia's ancestor, extending the chain back further. Ann is Jesse's ancestor, so the lineage continues: Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Now looking at Ann, Elijah appears to be her ancestor.\n\nThis extends the chain to: Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Elijah himself has an ancestor in Adam, pushing the lineage back even further.\n\nSo the full chain becomes: Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. And Adam has Karen as an ancestor, continuing the line backward.\n\nThis gives us: Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Karen is descended from Amanda, so Amanda becomes the next link in the chain.\n\nThe lineage now reads: Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Emma is Amanda's ancestor, extending the chain one more generation back.\n\nThis produces: Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Carolyn precedes Emma in the ancestral line, and Andrew comes before Carolyn. The chain extends back to Andrew, with Sean appearing next in the sequence. Olivia descends from Timothy, extending the chain further back: Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nTimothy himself has Catherine as an ancestor, so the full lineage traces back to Catherine → Timothy, with the rest of the chain continuing forward through all the descendants listed.\n\nCatherine connects further back to George as her ancestor, extending the chain to George → Catherine → Timothy and onward through the entire sequence to Joan.\n\nGeorge himself descends from Christina, so the complete ancestral line begins with Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy, continuing through all subsequent descendants down to Joan.\n\nThis chain traces back one more generation to Douglas as Christina's ancestor, establishing the full lineage: Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane.\n\nI can extend this further by identifying Jennifer as Douglas's ancestor, which pushes the chain back to Jennifer → Douglas → Christina and continues through to Diane. Then Brittany emerges as Jennifer's ancestor, extending the lineage to Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda.\n\nNow I see that Brittany has an ancestor in Alice, so the full chain becomes Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nLooking further back, Matthew is Alice's ancestor, which extends the lineage to Matthew → Alice. And Matthew himself descends from Terry, so the complete chain traces back to Terry → Matthew → Alice and continues forward through all the descendants listed.\n\nGoing even further, Terry is Dylan's descendant, meaning Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice, with the full line extending through Brittany, Jennifer, Douglas, Christina, and continuing all the way down to Joan.\n\nNathan is Dylan's ancestor (Nathan → Dylan), so the complete lineage runs: Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice.\n\nPamela is Nathan's ancestor (Pamela → Nathan), extending the chain further back: Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nJoshua is Pamela's ancestor (Joshua → Pamela), so the full lineage begins with Joshua and continues through the entire chain.\n\nJudith is Joshua's ancestor (Judith → Joshua), which means the complete ancestral line starts with Judith: Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nDenise is Judith's ancestor (Denise → Judith), so the full chain extends back further: Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly.\n\nAaron is Denise's ancestor, which means the lineage continues backward to Aaron → Denise, extending the entire sequence from Aaron through to Willie and beyond toward Joan.\n\nNancy is Aaron's ancestor, so the chain extends further back: Nancy → Aaron → Denise, and this continues through the full line to Willie and Joan.\n\nRoy is Nancy's ancestor, establishing Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise as the beginning of this extended lineage.\n\nJordan is Roy's ancestor, making Jordan the earliest point in this chain: Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy, continuing through to Joan. Gregory is Lauren's ancestor, so the full lineage extends back through him. The chain continues: Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nDanielle is Gregory's ancestor, which means the lineage extends even further back. The complete chain traces from Danielle through Gregory and continues all the way through to Joan.\n\nSince Danielle is Teresa's descendant, the full ancestral line actually begins with Teresa, flowing through Danielle and Gregory before continuing through the rest of the sequence down to Joan.\n\nBut Teresa herself descends from Laura, which means the chain extends further back: Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → ... → Joan.\n\nAnd Laura has an ancestor in Sharon, so the lineage traces back even further to Sharon as the starting point of this entire descent. Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nAlbert descends from Jose, making the complete lineage Jose through to Joan, with Albert as the ancestor of Sharon who begins the previously identified chain. Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nSara:\n- Abigail is Sara's ancestor (Abigail → Sara)\n\nThis extends the chain further back: Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nAbigail:\n- Diana is Abigail's ancestor (Diana → Abigail)\n\nTracing back one more generation, the full lineage begins with Diana and continues through the entire chain ending at Joan. Ronald is Dorothy's ancestor, which means I can extend the chain backward. The full lineage traces from Ronald through Dorothy, then continues with Diana and all subsequent descendants: Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nBut Ronald himself descends from Alexis, so I can push the chain back further. Joe is Alexis's ancestor, making the complete lineage: Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nEugene is Joe's ancestor, so the full chain extends back one more generation: Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nSince Eugene descends from Janet, I can trace the lineage even further back: Janet → Eugene → Joe, which means the complete ancestral line begins with Janet and continues through all the subsequent descendants down to Joan. Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nGabriel is Russell's ancestor, which means the chain extends further back: Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith →\n\nJoshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry (connecting back to the main chain), and continuing through Matthew, Alice, and the rest of the sequence, eventually reaching Bradley → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → Philip → Mark → Melissa.\n\nFollowing the chain further: Evelyn → Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan.\n\nGabriel appears at the beginning of this ancestral line, making him Joan's ancestor.

Gabriel is ancestor of Russell, and Russell is Janet's ancestor, so I can trace Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene. Eugene is Joe's ancestor, so I can continue building this chain.\n\nFollowing the descendant relationships: Joe has Alexis as a descendant, Alexis has Ronald as a descendant, and Ronald is Dorothy's ancestor. From Dorothy, Diana is a descendant, and Abigail is Diana's descendant. Since Abigail is Sara's ancestor, I can extend the path all the way through: Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara.\n\nContinuing from Sara: she's an ancestor of Jose, who has Albert as a descendant. Albert then has Sharon as a descendant, and Sharon is an ancestor of Laura. Finally, Teresa is Laura's descendant, completing the full lineage from Gabriel through Teresa.\n\nFrom there, Danielle descends from Teresa, making Danielle an ancestor of Gregory. Gregory himself is an ancestor of Lauren, extending the chain all the way to: Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren.\n\nJordan descends from Lauren, so the lineage continues through Jordan. Roy then descends from Jordan, followed by Nancy descending from Roy. Aaron descends from Nancy, and Denise descends from Aaron. Judith is a descendant of Denise, Joshua descends from Judith, and Pamela descends from Joshua, completing the full ancestral line: Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela.\n\nContinuing forward, Nathan descends from Pamela, Dylan descends from Nathan, and Terry is Dylan's descendant. Matthew descends from Terry, Brittany descends from Matthew, and Jennifer descends from Brittany. Douglas is Jennifer's descendant, extending the chain further down the generations.\n\nChristina descends from Douglas, George descends from Christina, and Catherine descends from George. Timothy is Catherine's descendant, Olivia descends from Timothy, and Julia descends from Olivia. Sean is Julia's descendant, and Andrew is Sean's descendant, continuing the lineage from Gabriel through all these generations.\n\nCarolyn descends from Andrew, Emma is Carolyn's descendant, and Amanda descends from Emma. Karen is Amanda's descendant, Adam is Karen's descendant, and Elijah descends from Adam. Ann is Elijah's descendant, with Jesse being Ann's descendant, extending the chain further: Gabriel → ... → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse.\n\nContinuing forward, Cynthia descends from Jesse, Martha from Cynthia, and Lisa from Martha. Nicole is Lisa's descendant, Bruce descends from Nicole, Sophia from Bruce, and Susan from Sophia. Cheryl is Susan's descendant, completing the lineage: Gabriel → ... → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl.\n\nFrom there, Christian descends from Cheryl, Kathleen from Christian, Kimberly from Kathleen, and Raymond from Kimberly. David is Raymond's descendant, Angela descends from David, and Jack from Angela. The full chain extends: Gabriel → ... → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack.\n\nContinuing forward, Charlotte descends from Jack, Beverly from Charlotte, and Michelle from Beverly. Austin is Michelle's descendant, Frances from Austin, Donald from Frances, Debra from Donald, and finally Janice from Debra. This gives us: Gabriel → ... → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice.\n\nKyle descends from Janice, Paul from Kyle, and Jacob from Paul. Jacob is an ancestor of Diane, who is an ancestor of Bobby, who is an ancestor of Willie, who is an ancestor of Bradley, who is an ancestor of Scott. Sarah is Scott's descendant, extending the line: Gabriel → ... → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → Bradley → Scott → Sarah.\n\nContinuing forward, Scott is an ancestor of Sarah, who is an ancestor of Henry. Henry is an ancestor of Marilyn, Marilyn of Benjamin, and Benjamin of Jacqueline. Jacqueline is an ancestor of Helen, Helen of Thomas, and Thomas of Marie. This gives us: Gabriel → ... → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie.\n\nMarie is Jason, so Jason follows in the line. Jason is an ancestor of Emily, Emily of Ashley, and Ashley of Jonathan. Jonathan is an ancestor of Barbara, Barbara of Larry, and Larry of Doris. Doris is an ancestor of Kenneth, and Kenneth of Nicholas. The complete chain extends: Gabriel → ... → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas.\n\nNicholas is Carol's ancestor, placing Carol after Nicholas in the sequence. Carol is an ancestor of Maria, so Maria follows Carol. The extended line now reads: Gabriel → ... → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria.\n\nShirley is Deborah's descendant, making Deborah an ancestor of Shirley. However, these two don't connect directly to the main chain yet. Looking at the relationships involving Eugene: Eugene is Joe's ancestor and Eugene is Janet's descendant, meaning Janet → Eugene → Joe. I need to determine how Eugene's line connects to the rest of the family tree.\n\nTo locate Joan, I can trace backward from her known connections. William is Joan's ancestor, so William → Joan. Brian connects to William as his ancestor, creating Brian → William → Joan. Continuing this pattern upward: Gerald → Brian → William → Joan, then Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan, then Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan. Following the chain further back, Mason is Eric's ancestor, and Judy is Mason's ancestor, extending the line to Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan.\n\nMoving further up the family tree, Betty connects as Judy's ancestor, followed by Christine as Betty's ancestor, then Natalie as Christine's ancestor. Anna is Natalie's ancestor, and Linda is Anna's ancestor. Ruth connects to Linda as her ancestor, giving me Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan.\n\nContinuing backward, Virginia is Ruth's ancestor, Carl is Virginia's ancestor, and Jeremy is Carl's ancestor. This extends the chain to Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan. Theresa appears to be Jeremy's ancestor, though the connection is still being traced.\n\nMoving further back, Brandon connects as Theresa's ancestor, Gary as Brandon's ancestor, Michael as Gary's ancestor, and Evelyn as Michael's ancestor. The lineage continues: Evelyn → Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth and down to Joan. Melissa connects as Evelyn's ancestor, extending the chain even further back.\n\nFrom Melissa, Mark is her ancestor, Philip is Mark's ancestor, and Shirley is Philip's ancestor. This creates the extended lineage: Shirley → Philip → Mark → Melissa → Evelyn → Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → ... → Joan. Now examining Deborah's connections to see if she fits as Shirley's ancestor in this chain.\n\nGabriel doesn't appear to connect directly to Deborah through the relationships I've identified. Let me trace forward from Gabriel instead. Gabriel connects to Russell, who connects to Janet, and Janet connects to Eugene. From Eugene, the line continues through Joe to Alexis. I need to verify these connections more carefully—particularly whether Eugene descends from Janet, and whether this chain eventually reaches the Joan lineage.\n\nFollowing the path: Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana. This extended chain shows how Gabriel's line progresses through multiple generations, though I still need to determine if it intersects with either Deborah or Joan.\n\nLet me trace backward from Judy to see if there's a connection to Gabriel. Working through the ancestors: Betty → Judy, Christine → Betty, Natalie → Christine, and Linda → Anna → Natalie. Ruth appears as Linda's ancestor, which means Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy. Now I need to check whether Gabriel's line connects to Ruth.\n\nCarl is Virginia's ancestor, so Carl → Virginia → Ruth. This extends the chain: Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan.\n\nNow I'm checking if Gabriel connects to Carl. Carl descends from Jeremy, who descends from Theresa. Brandon is Theresa's ancestor, and tracing further back: Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl. Michael is Gary's ancestor, Evelyn is Michael's ancestor, and Melissa is Evelyn's ancestor. So the line continues: Melissa → Evelyn → Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl.\n\nFollowing this further, Mark is Melissa's ancestor, Philip is Mark's ancestor, and Shirley is Philip's ancestor. This gives me: Shirley → Philip → Mark → Melissa → Evelyn → ... → Carl. Deborah is Shirley's ancestor, extending the chain back to: Deborah → Shirley → Philip → Mark → Melissa → Evelyn → ... → Carl.\n\nNow I need to determine if Gabriel connects to Deborah. Looking at Deborah's connections, Shirley is her descendant, but I don't see other direct links. Let me explore another direction—checking what Joan connects to going upward through her ancestors, starting with Joan ← William ← Brian.\n\nSince Brian is Gerald's descendant and William's ancestor, I can trace: Gerald → Brian → William → Joan. Continuing backward, Stephen is Gerald's ancestor and Eric is Stephen's ancestor, so: Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan. Mason is Eric's descendant and Judy is Mason's descendant, giving me: Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan.\n\nWorking further back, Betty is Judy's ancestor and Christine is Betty's ancestor, so: Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan. Natalie is Christine's ancestor and Anna is Natalie's ancestor, extending the chain to: Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan.\n\nI need to continue tracing Anna's ancestors to complete the full lineage. Carl is Jeremy's descendant (Jeremy → Carl).\n\nThe chain extends: Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan\n\nTracing Jeremy back, Theresa is his ancestor (Theresa → Jeremy). Brandon precedes Theresa in the line (Brandon → Theresa). Gary is Brandon's ancestor (Gary → Brandon), and Michael is Gary's ancestor (Michael → Gary).\n\nThe full sequence now reads: Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan\n\nContinuing backward from Michael: Evelyn is his ancestor (Evelyn → Michael), Melissa precedes Evelyn (Melissa → Evelyn), Mark is Melissa's ancestor (Mark → Melissa), Philip is Mark's ancestor (Philip → Mark), and Shirley precedes Philip (Shirley → Philip).\n\nThe complete lineage is: Shirley → Philip → Mark → Melissa → Evelyn → Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan\n\nNow tracing back from Shirley: Deborah is her ancestor (Deborah → Shirley). Looking further, I notice Deborah is Maria's descendant, and Maria descends from Carol. So the full chain extends: Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → Philip → Mark → Melissa → Evelyn → Michael → Gary → Brandon → Theresa → Jeremy → Carl → Virginia → Ruth → Linda → Anna → Natalie → Christine → Betty → Judy → Mason → Eric → Stephen → Gerald → Brian → William → Joan\n\n.\n\nContinuing backward, Carol has an ancestor in Nicholas (Nicholas → Carol), making the line: Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Kenneth is Nicholas's ancestor (Kenneth → Nicholas), so: Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. And Doris is Kenneth's ancestor (Doris → Kenneth), extending it further: Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nMoving further back, Larry is Doris's ancestor (Larry → Doris), so: Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Barbara is Larry's ancestor (Barbara → Larry), giving: Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Jonathan is Barbara's ancestor (Jonathan → Barbara), so: Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Ashley is Jonathan's ancestor (Ashley → Jonathan), so: Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Finally, Emily is Ashley's ancestor (Emily → Ashley), making the full line: Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nContinuing backward, Jason is Emily's ancestor (Jason → Emily), so: Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Marie is Jason's ancestor (Marie → Jason), so: Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Thomas is Marie's ancestor (Thomas → Marie), so: Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Helen is Thomas's ancestor (Helen → Thomas), so: Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nJacqueline is Helen's ancestor (Jacqueline → Helen), so: Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Benjamin is Jacqueline's ancestor (Benjamin → Jacqueline), so: Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Marilyn is Benjamin's ancestor (Marilyn → Benjamin), so: Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nHenry is Marilyn's ancestor (Henry → Marilyn), so: Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Sarah is Henry's ancestor (Sarah → Henry), so: Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nScott is Sarah's ancestor (Scott → Sarah), so: Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Bradley is Scott's ancestor (Bradley → Scott), so: Bradley → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Willie is Bradley's ancestor (Willie → Bradley), so: Willie → Bradley → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason.\n\nContinuing the chain, Bobby is Willie's ancestor (Bobby → Willie), so: Bobby → Willie → Bradley → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan. Diane is Bobby's ancestor (Diane → Bobby), so: Diane → Bobby → Willie → Bradley → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → Thomas → Marie → Jason → Emily → Ashley → Jonathan → Barbara → Larry → Doris → Kenneth → Nicholas → Carol → Maria → Deborah → Shirley → ... → Joan.\n\nJacob is Diane's ancestor (Jacob → Diane), so: Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → Bradley → Scott → Sarah → Henry → Marilyn → Benjamin → Jacqueline → Helen → ... → Joan.\n\nI still need to find where Gabriel connects. Gabriel → Russell → Janet, and Janet has Eugene as a descendant (Janet → Eugene). From Eugene, Joe is a descendant (Eugene → Joe), and from Joe, Alexis is a descendant (Joe → Alexis). From Alexis, Ronald is a descendant (Alexis → Ronald).\n\nRonald is Dorothy's ancestor (Ronald → Dorothy), so: Gabriel → Russell → Janet → Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy. From Dorothy, Diana is a descendant (Dorothy → Diana), and from Diana, Abigail is a descendant (Diana → Abigail).\n\nThe Gabriel chain doesn't seem to connect to Joan's chain yet. I should check if there's a common ancestor linking them. Looking back at Jacob—Paul is Jacob's ancestor (Paul → Jacob), so there might be a connection through Paul.\n\nTracing Paul's lineage: Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Kyle connects to Paul, and Janice is Kyle's ancestor (Janice → Kyle). Following further back: Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Debra is Janice's ancestor, and Donald appears to be Debra's ancestor, so I need to continue tracing Donald to see if this chain eventually connects to Gabriel's line.\n\nWorking backward through the ancestry: Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Frances is Donald's ancestor, then Austin is Frances's ancestor, and Michelle is Austin's ancestor. Beverly is Michelle's ancestor, and Charlotte is Beverly's ancestor. The chain now extends: Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nContinuing further back, Jack is Charlotte's ancestor, Angela is Jack's ancestor, and David is Angela's ancestor. This extends the lineage to: David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nRaymond is David's ancestor, making the chain: Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nKimberly is Raymond's ancestor, and Kathleen is Kimberly's ancestor, extending the full lineage back to: Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nChristian is Kathleen's ancestor, and Cheryl is Christian's ancestor, pushing the chain further back: Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nSusan is Cheryl's ancestor, so the complete lineage traces back to Susan at the beginning of this ancestral chain.\n\nSophia is Susan's ancestor, and Bruce is Sophia's ancestor, extending the full lineage to: Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nNicole is Bruce's ancestor, and Lisa is Nicole's ancestor, which means the chain continues further back: Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nMartha appears to be connected to Lisa in this genealogical sequence. Jesse is Cynthia's ancestor, extending the chain back further. Ann is Jesse's ancestor, so the lineage continues: Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Now looking at Ann, Elijah appears to be her ancestor.\n\nThis extends the chain to: Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Elijah himself has an ancestor in Adam, pushing the lineage back even further.\n\nSo the full chain becomes: Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. And Adam has Karen as an ancestor, continuing the line backward.\n\nThis gives us: Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Karen is descended from Amanda, so Amanda becomes the next link in the chain.\n\nThe lineage now reads: Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Emma is Amanda's ancestor, extending the chain one more generation back.\n\nThis produces: Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan. Carolyn precedes Emma in the ancestral line, and Andrew comes before Carolyn. The chain extends back to Andrew, with Sean appearing next in the sequence. Olivia descends from Timothy, extending the chain further back: Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nTimothy himself has Catherine as an ancestor, so the full lineage traces back to Catherine → Timothy, with the rest of the chain continuing forward through all the descendants listed.\n\nCatherine connects further back to George as her ancestor, extending the chain to George → Catherine → Timothy and onward through the entire sequence to Joan.\n\nGeorge himself descends from Christina, so the complete ancestral line begins with Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy, continuing through all subsequent descendants down to Joan.\n\nThis chain traces back one more generation to Douglas as Christina's ancestor, establishing the full lineage: Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane.\n\nI can extend this further by identifying Jennifer as Douglas's ancestor, which pushes the chain back to Jennifer → Douglas → Christina and continues through to Diane. Then Brittany emerges as Jennifer's ancestor, extending the lineage to Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda.\n\nNow I see that Brittany has an ancestor in Alice, so the full chain becomes Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nLooking further back, Matthew is Alice's ancestor, which extends the lineage to Matthew → Alice. And Matthew himself descends from Terry, so the complete chain traces back to Terry → Matthew → Alice and continues forward through all the descendants listed.\n\nGoing even further, Terry is Dylan's descendant, meaning Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice, with the full line extending through Brittany, Jennifer, Douglas, Christina, and continuing all the way down to Joan.\n\nNathan is Dylan's ancestor (Nathan → Dylan), so the complete lineage runs: Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice.\n\nPamela is Nathan's ancestor (Pamela → Nathan), extending the chain further back: Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nJoshua is Pamela's ancestor (Joshua → Pamela), so the full lineage begins with Joshua and continues through the entire chain.\n\nJudith is Joshua's ancestor (Judith → Joshua), which means the complete ancestral line starts with Judith: Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan.\n\nDenise is Judith's ancestor (Denise → Judith), so the full chain extends back further: Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly.\n\nAaron is Denise's ancestor, which means the lineage continues backward to Aaron → Denise, extending the entire sequence from Aaron through to Willie and beyond toward Joan.\n\nNancy is Aaron's ancestor, so the chain extends further back: Nancy → Aaron → Denise, and this continues through the full line to Willie and Joan.\n\nRoy is Nancy's ancestor, establishing Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise as the beginning of this extended lineage.\n\nJordan is Roy's ancestor, making Jordan the earliest point in this chain: Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy, continuing through to Joan. Gregory is Lauren's ancestor, so the full lineage extends back through him. The chain continues: Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nDanielle is Gregory's ancestor, which means the lineage extends even further back. The complete chain traces from Danielle through Gregory and continues all the way through to Joan.\n\nSince Danielle is Teresa's descendant, the full ancestral line actually begins with Teresa, flowing through Danielle and Gregory before continuing through the rest of the sequence down to Joan.\n\nBut Teresa herself descends from Laura, which means the chain extends further back: Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → ... → Joan.\n\nAnd Laura has an ancestor in Sharon, so the lineage traces back even further to Sharon as the starting point of this entire descent. Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nAlbert descends from Jose, making the complete lineage Jose through to Joan, with Albert as the ancestor of Sharon who begins the previously identified chain. Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nSara:\n- Abigail is Sara's ancestor (Abigail → Sara)\n\nThis extends the chain further back: Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nAbigail:\n- Diana is Abigail's ancestor (Diana → Abigail)\n\nTracing back one more generation, the full lineage begins with Diana and continues through the entire chain ending at Joan. Ronald is Dorothy's ancestor, which means I can extend the chain backward. The full lineage traces from Ronald through Dorothy, then continues with Diana and all subsequent descendants: Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nBut Ronald himself descends from Alexis, so I can push the chain back further. Joe is Alexis's ancestor, making the complete lineage: Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nEugene is Joe's ancestor, so the full chain extends back one more generation: Eugene → Joe → Alexis → Ronald → Dorothy → Diana → Abigail → Sara → Jose → Albert → Sharon → Laura → Teresa → Danielle → Gregory → Lauren → Jordan → Roy → Nancy → Aaron → Denise → Judith → Joshua → Pamela → Nathan → Dylan → Terry → Matthew → Alice → Brittany → Jennifer → Douglas → Christina → George → Catherine → Timothy → Olivia → Julia → Sean → Andrew → Carolyn → Emma → Amanda → Karen → Adam → Elijah → Ann → Jesse → Cynthia → Martha → Lisa → Nicole → Bruce → Sophia → Susan → Cheryl → Christian → Kathleen → Kimberly → Raymond → David → Angela → Jack → Charlotte → Beverly → Michelle → Austin → Frances → Donald → Debra → Janice → Kyle → Paul → Jacob → Diane → Bobby → Willie → ... → Joan\n\nSince Eugene descends from Janet, I can trace the lineage even further back: Janet → Eugene → Joe, which means the complete ancestral line begins with Janet and continues through all the subsequent descendants down to Joan.
