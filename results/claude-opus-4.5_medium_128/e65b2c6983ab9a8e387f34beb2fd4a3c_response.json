Let me check again.\n  \nLet me organize the relationships:\n- Roger is Jordan's ancestor (Roger → Jordan)\n- Roger is Patrick's descendant (Patrick → Roger)\n- Patrick is Joseph's descendant (Joseph → Patrick)\n- So: Joseph → Patrick → Roger → Jordan → Janice\n- Linda is Joseph's ancestor (Linda → Joseph)\n- Ashley is Linda's ancestor (Ashley → Linda)\n- Helen is Ashley's ancestor (Helen → Ashley)\n\nSo: Helen → Ashley → Linda → Joseph → Patrick → Roger → Jordan → Janice\n\nNow let me trace Betty:\n- Betty is Elizabeth's ancestor (Betty → Elizabeth)\n- Elizabeth is Dorothy's ancestor (Betty → Elizabeth → Dorothy)\n- Dorothy is Bryan's ancestor (Betty → Elizabeth → Dorothy → Bryan)\n- Joe is Bryan's descendant (Bryan → Joe)\n- Joe is Anna's ancestor (Bryan → Joe → Anna)\n- Nicole is Anna's descendant (Anna → Nicole)\n- Wayne is Nicole's descendant (Nicole → Wayne)\n- Gabriel is Wayne's descendant (Wayne → Gabriel)\n\n\n- Gabriel is Shirley's ancestor (Gabriel → Shirley)\n\nI need to clarify the direction: \"X is Y's descendant\" means Y → X, and \"X is Y's ancestor\" means X → Y. So the chain from Betty continues: Betty → Elizabeth → Dorothy → Bryan → Joe → Anna → Nicole → Wayne → Gabriel → Shirley.\n\nFrom Shirley, I can trace forward: Shirley → Russell → Sara → Dylan → Brittany → Deborah → Austin → Sarah → Jacob, and Jacob is Abigail's ancestor, so Jacob → Abigail.\n\nContinuing the chain from Abigail: Abigail → Joan → Lauren → Kenneth → Ryan → Arthur → Kelly → Terry → Noah → Olivia → Amy → Eugene → Susan → Jeffrey → Lori → Benjamin.\n\nBenjamin connects forward through Julia, Judith, and Jonathan to Jerry, then through Samuel, Christian, and Harold to Catherine. From there the line extends through Samantha, Carol, and Stephanie to Ethan, who precedes Frank. Vincent descends from Frank, Mary from Vincent, and finally Mary is Dennis's ancestor.\n\nContinuing from Dennis, the chain moves through John and Joyce to Sean, then Frances and Bruce. Beverly descends from Bruce and serves as ancestor to Aaron, with Jessica following as Aaron's descendant. The succession then flows through Amber, Philip, Debra, and Brian, where Brian becomes Isabella's ancestor. Isabella precedes Melissa, Barbara descends from Melissa, and Barbara is Julie's ancestor.\n\nFrom Julie, Lawrence is her descendant, followed by Jeremy as Lawrence's descendant. Jeremy stands as Thomas's ancestor, with Scott descending from Thomas. Margaret descends from Scott, Carl from Margaret, and Carl becomes Gerald's ancestor. Jack descends from Gerald and is Nathan's ancestor, Nathan is Randy's ancestor, and Kayla descends from Randy. Karen follows as Kayla's descendant, with Karen as Bradley's ancestor. Bradley leads to Doris, Doris to Sharon, and Sharon to Patricia.\n\nPatricia connects forward through Lisa as her descendant, Lisa to Janet, and Janet to Alexander. Matthew descends from Alexander, Danielle from Matthew, and Charles from Danielle. Charles serves as Grace's ancestor, Grace as Alan's ancestor, and George descends from Alan. Nicholas follows from George, standing as Sandra's ancestor. Ann descends from Sandra, Jean from Ann, Steven from Jean, and William from Steven. William is Joshua's ancestor, with Joshua descending further.\n\nJoshua connects to Alexis as his descendant, Alexis to Diane, and Diane to Heather. Kevin descends from Heather, with Kevin as Megan's ancestor. Evelyn descends from Megan, Kathryn from Evelyn, and Kathryn serves as Bobby's ancestor. Bobby is Jennifer's ancestor, Tyler descends from Jennifer, and Eric descends from Tyler. Zachary descends from Eric, Donald from Zachary, and Michael continues the line.\n\nMichael descends from Donald, leading through Gary, Stephen, and Jason. Donna descends from Jason, Timothy from Donna, Walter from Timothy, Katherine from Walter, Natalie from Katherine, and Helen from Natalie. This connects to the earlier chain starting with Helen → Ashley → Linda → Joseph through to Janice, and also to Betty's line through Elizabeth, Dorothy, Bryan, Joe, Anna, Nicole, Wayne, Gabriel, Shirley, Russell, Sara, Dylan, Brittany, Deborah, Austin, Sarah, Jacob, Abigail, and Joan.\n\nThe chain continues through Lauren, Kenneth, Ryan, Arthur, Kelly, Terry, Noah, Olivia, Amy, Eugene, Susan, Jeffrey, Lori, Benjamin, Julia, Judith, Jonathan, Jerry, Samuel, Christian, Harold, Catherine, Samantha, Carol, Stephanie, Ethan, Frank, Vincent, Mary, Dennis, John, Joyce, Sean, Frances, Bruce, Beverly, Aaron, Jessica, Amber, Philip, Debra, Brian, Isabella, Melissa, Barbara, Julie, Lawrence, Jeremy, Thomas, Scott, Margaret, Carl, Gerald, Jack, Nathan, Randy, Kayla, Karen, Bradley, Doris, Sharon, Patricia, Lisa, Janet, Alexander, Matthew, Danielle, Charles, Grace, Alan, George, Nicholas, Sandra, Ann, Jean, Steven, William, Joshua, Alexis, Diane, Heather, Kevin, Megan, Evelyn, Kathryn, Bobby, Jennifer, Tyler, Eric, Zachary, and back to Donald, which then loops through Michael, Gary, Stephen, Jason, Donna, Timothy, and Walter.\n\nFrom there it extends to Katherine, Natalie, and Helen. This is quite an extensive lineage. Let me trace what comes after Helen: Helen connects to Ashley, who connects to Linda, who connects to Joseph. Now I need to determine Joseph's position—Patrick is Joseph's descendant, and Linda is Joseph's ancestor, so the chain continues downward from Joseph through Patrick.\n\nPatrick leads to Roger, who leads to Jordan, and Jordan leads to Janice. So the complete ancestral line runs from Betty all the way through to Janice, passing through dozens of intermediate generations including Elizabeth, Dorothy, Bryan, Joe, Anna, Nicole, Wayne, Gabriel, Shirley, Russell, Sara, Dylan, Brittany, Deborah, Austin, Sarah, Jacob, Abigail, Joan, Lauren, Kenneth, Ryan, Arthur, Kelly, Terry, Noah, Olivia, Amy, Eugene, Susan, Jeffrey, Lori, Benjamin, Julia, Judith, Jonathan, Jerry, Samuel, Christian, Harold, Catherine, Samantha, Carol, Stephanie, Ethan, Frank, Vincent, Mary, Dennis, John, Joyce, Sean, Frances, and Bruce.\n\nContinuing through Beverly, Aaron, Jessica, Amber, Philip, Debra, Brian, Isabella, Melissa, Barbara, Julie, Lawrence, Jeremy, Thomas, Scott, Margaret, Carl, Gerald, Jack, Nathan, Randy, Kayla, Karen, Bradley, Doris, Sharon, Patricia, Lisa, Janet, Alexander, Matthew, Danielle, Charles, Grace, Alan, George, Nicholas, Sandra, Ann, Jean, Steven, William, Joshua, Alexis, Diane, Heather, Kevin, Megan, Evelyn, Kathryn, Bobby, Jennifer, Tyler, Eric, Zachary, Donald, Michael, Gary, Stephen, Jason, Donna, Timothy, Walter, Katherine, Natalie, Helen, Ashley, Linda, Joseph, and finally Patrick, Roger, and Jordan to reach Janice. This confirms Betty is indeed an ancestor of Janice.\n\nLet me verify some of the key connections: Betty → Elizabeth → Dorothy → Bryan → Joe → Anna → Nicole → Wayne → Gabriel → Shirley → Russell → Sara → Dylan → Brittany. Each link checks out—Betty precedes Elizabeth, Elizabeth precedes Dorothy, Dorothy precedes Bryan, Bryan precedes Joe, Joe precedes Anna, Anna precedes Nicole, Nicole precedes Wayne, Wayne precedes Gabriel, Gabriel precedes Shirley, Shirley precedes Russell, Russell precedes Sara, Sara precedes Dylan, and Dylan precedes Brittany.\n\nContinuing the chain: Brittany → Deborah → Austin → Sarah → Jacob → Abigail → Joan → Lauren → Kenneth → Ryan → Arthur → Kelly. I can trace Brittany as Deborah's ancestor, Deborah as Austin's ancestor, Austin as Sarah's ancestor, Sarah as Jacob's ancestor, Jacob as Abigail's ancestor, Abigail as Joan's ancestor, Joan as Lauren's ancestor, Lauren as Kenneth's ancestor, Kenneth as Ryan's ancestor, Ryan as Arthur's ancestor, and Arthur as Kelly's ancestor.\n\nFrom Kelly onward, the lineage extends through Terry, Noah, Olivia, Amy, Eugene, Susan, Jeffrey, Lori, Benjamin, Julia, Judith, and Jonathan. Kelly is Terry's ancestor, Terry is Noah's ancestor, Noah is Olivia's ancestor, Olivia is Amy's ancestor, Amy is Eugene's ancestor, Eugene is Susan's ancestor, Susan is Jeffrey's ancestor, Jeffrey is Lori's ancestor, Lori is Benjamin's ancestor, Benjamin is Julia's ancestor, Julia is Judith's ancestor, and Judith is Jonathan's ancestor.\n\nContinuing forward, Jonathan is Jerry's ancestor, Jerry is Samuel's ancestor, Samuel is Christian's ancestor, Christian is Harold's ancestor, Harold is Catherine's ancestor, Catherine is Samantha's ancestor, Samantha is Carol's ancestor, Carol is Stephanie's ancestor, Stephanie is Ethan's ancestor, Ethan is Frank's ancestor, and Frank is Vincent's ancestor. The chain continues with Mary as the next person in the sequence.\n\nMary descends from Vincent, then becomes Dennis's ancestor, Dennis precedes John, John precedes Joyce, Joyce precedes Sean, Sean precedes Frances, Frances precedes Bruce, Bruce precedes Beverly, Beverly precedes Aaron, Aaron precedes Jessica, Jessica precedes Amber, Amber precedes Philip, and Philip precedes Debra.\n\nContinuing from Debra: Brian follows Debra in the line, then Isabella follows Brian, Melissa follows Isabella, Barbara follows Melissa, Julie follows Barbara, Lawrence follows Julie, Jeremy follows Lawrence, Thomas follows Jeremy, Scott follows Thomas, Margaret follows Scott, Carl follows Margaret, and Gerald follows Carl.\n\nFrom Gerald, Jack descends, then Nathan from Jack, Randy from Nathan, Kayla from Randy, Karen from Kayla, Bradley from Karen, Doris from Bradley, Sharon from Doris, Patricia from Sharon, Lisa from Patricia, Janet from Lisa, and Alexander from Janet.\n\nMatthew descends from Alexander, followed by Danielle from Matthew, Charles from Danielle, Grace from Charles, Alan from Grace, George from Alan, Nicholas from George, Sandra from Nicholas, Ann from Sandra, Jean from Ann, Steven from Jean, William from Steven, and Joshua from William.\n\nContinuing the chain: Joshua connects to Alexis, Alexis to Diane, Diane to Heather, Kevin to Heather, Megan to Kevin, Evelyn to Megan, Kathryn to Evelyn, Bobby to Kathryn, Jennifer to Bobby, and Tyler to Jennifer.\n\nFrom Tyler, the lineage extends through Eric to Zachary, then Donald descends from Zachary. Michael follows as Donald's descendant, with Gary descending from Michael. Stephen comes from Gary, Jason from Stephen, and Donna as Jason's descendant. Timothy descends from Donna, Walter from Timothy, Katherine from Walter, and finally Natalie from Katherine.\n\nContinuing the chain: Helen descends from Natalie, Ashley from Helen, Linda from Ashley, and Joseph from Linda. Patrick descends from Joseph, Roger from Patrick, Jordan from Roger, and Janice from Jordan. The complete ancestral line traces from Betty through Elizabeth, Dorothy, Bryan, Joe, Anna, Nicole, Wayne, Gabriel, Shirley, Russell, Sara, Dylan, Brittany, Deborah, Austin, Sarah, Jacob, Abigail, Joan, Lauren, Kenneth, Ryan, Arthur, Kelly, Terry, Noah, Olivia, Amy, Eugene, Susan, Jeffrey, and beyond.\n\nThe chain extends through Lori, Benjamin, Julia, Judith, Jonathan, Jerry, Samuel, Christian, Harold, Catherine, Samantha, Carol, Stephanie, Ethan, Frank, Vincent, Mary, Dennis, John, Joyce, Sean, Frances, Bruce, Beverly, Aaron, Jessica, Amber, Philip, Debra, Brian, Isabella, Melissa, Barbara, Julie, Lawrence, Jeremy, Thomas, Scott, Margaret, Carl, Gerald, Jack, Nathan, Randy, Kayla, Karen, Bradley, Doris, Sharon, Patricia, Lisa, Janet, Alexander, Matthew, Danielle, Charles, Grace, Alan, George, Nicholas, Sandra, Ann, Jean, Steven, William, Joshua, Alexis, Diane, Heather, Kevin, Megan, Evelyn, Kathryn, Bobby, Jennifer, Tyler, Eric, Zachary, Donald, Michael, Gary, Stephen, Jason, Donna, and Timothy.\n\nContinuing from there: Walter, Katherine, Natalie, Helen, Ashley, Linda, Joseph, Patrick, Roger, Jordan, and finally Janice.
