So Emma is a descendant of Alice.\n\nFor Austin:\n\n- Anna is Austin's ancestor. So Austin is a descendant of Anna.\n\nNow, is there any link between Alice and Anna?\n\nLook at the list: \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant.\" But Jennifer might not be directly related.\n\n\"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" and \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — so Anna is a descendant of Jennifer, meaning Jennifer is an ancestor of Anna.\n\nSimilarly, for Alice, I don't have direct information, but let's see.\n\nThere's \"Joshua is Alice's ancestor.\" So Joshua is an ancestor of Alice.\n\nAlso, \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor.\" But Charlotte might not be related.\n\nI need to find if Alice and Anna share a common ancestor or if one is related to the other.\n\nPerhaps through other people.\n\nAnother thing: \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant.\" And \"Jennifer\" might be connected elsewhere.\n\nBut I don't see Jennifer in other contexts directly.\n\nLet's list all mentions of Alice and Anna.\n\nFirst, Alice:\n\n- \"Joshua is Alice's ancestor.\" So Joshua → Alice (ancestor)\n\n- \"Alice is Emma's ancestor.\" So Alice → Emma (ancestor)\n\nSo for Emma, the chain is Joshua → Alice → Emma.\n\nNow for Austin:\n\n- \"Anna is Austin's ancestor.\" So Anna → Austin (ancestor)\n\n- \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant.\" So Jennifer → Anna (ancestor, since descendant means Anna is descendant of Jennifer, so Jennifer is ancestor of Anna)\n\n\"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" means Jennifer is an ancestor of Anna.\n\nSimilarly, \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" means Anna is an ancestor of Austin.\n\nSo for Austin, Jennifer → Anna → Austin.\n\nNow, is there a connection between Jennifer and Joshua or something?\n\nI need to see if Jennifer and Joshua are related.\n\nBut I don't have direct information.\n\nPerhaps through other people.\n\nFor example, is there a relationship that involves Jennifer or Joshua with others.\n\nLet's look for Jennifer.\n\nIn the list: \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant.\" That's the only mention of Jennifer, I think.\n\nSimilarly, Joshua: \"Joshua is Alice's ancestor\" and \"Joshua is Charlotte's descendant.\" Let me check.\n\n\"Joshua is Charlotte's descendant.\" Yes, it says: \"Joshua is Charlotte's descendant.\"\n\nAlso, \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor.\" \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor.\"\n\nAnd \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor\" — so Christopher is ancestor of Charlotte.\n\nBut Joshua is descendant of Charlotte, so Charlotte is ancestor of Joshua.\n\nSince Joshua is Charlotte's descendant, Charlotte is ancestor of Joshua.\n\nAnd Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor, so Christopher → Charlotte → Joshua.\n\nBut Joshua is also Alice's ancestor, so Joshua → Alice.\n\nSo Christopher → Charlotte → Joshua → Alice.\n\nThen Alice → Emma.\n\nSo for Emma: Christopher → Charlotte → Joshua → Alice → Emma.\n\nNow for Austin: Jennifer → Anna → Austin.\n\nBut what about Jennifer? Is Jennifer related to Christopher or Charlotte?\n\nI don't see any direct link.\n\nPerhaps through other connections.\n\nFor example, is there a relationship involving Jennifer?\n\nThe only mention is \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\", but that's it.\n\nSimilarly, for Austin, I have Anna → Austin, and Jennifer → Anna.\n\nBut Jennifer might not be connected to the Emma side.\n\nPerhaps I need to see if there's a common ancestor between the two lines.\n\nBut I don't have information about Jennifer or Anna elsewhere.\n\nAnother thing: \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — but Jennifer could be part of another family.\n\nSimilarly, for Emma, we have Christopher, Charlotte, etc.\n\nBut no link between them.\n\nPerhaps through Austin or Emma themselves, but that doesn't help.\n\nLet's see if there's any other fact about Austin or Emma.\n\nFor example, \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" — that's it for Austin directly.\n\n\"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — Jennifer is mentioned only here.\n\nSimilarly for Emma, only \"Alice is Emma's ancestor\" and \"Joshua is Alice's ancestor\", etc.\n\nBut let's see if Jennifer is connected to something else.\n\nFor instance, is there \"Jennifer\" in other contexts?\n\nThe list has: \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant.\" That's the only one.\n\nSimilarly, \"Jennifer\" doesn't appear elsewhere.\n\nBut \"Jennifer\" might be a person, and there might be relationships involving her, but in the list, only that one mention.\n\nSimilarly, for Austin, \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" is the only direct, but Anna is also mentioned in \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" and \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — that's for Anna.\n\nBut Jennifer is not connected to anything else.\n\nPerhaps I need to look for common ancestors through other paths.\n\nMaybe Austin and Emma are not directly related, but they might share a common ancestor if the family trees merge somewhere.\n\nBut from the given data, I don't see any connection between the two lines.\n\nLet's list all the people involved.\n\nFor Emma's side:\n\n- Emma\n\n- Alice (ancestor)\n\n- Joshua (ancestor of Alice)\n\n- Charlotte (ancestor of Joshua, since Joshua is Charlotte's descendant)\n\n- Christopher (ancestor of Charlotte)\n\nAlso, \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor\" — so Christopher → Charlotte\n\nJoshua is Charlotte's descendant, so Charlotte → Joshua\n\nJoshua is Alice's ancestor, so Joshua → Alice\n\nAlice is Emma's ancestor, so Alice → Emma\n\nSo chain: Christopher → Charlotte → Joshua → Alice → Emma\n\nNow for Austin's side:\n\n- Austin\n\n- Anna (ancestor)\n\n- Jennifer (ancestor of Anna, since Anna is Jennifer's descendant)\n\nSo Jennifer → Anna → Austin\n\nNow, is Jennifer related to Christopher or Charlotte?\n\nI don't see any relationship that links Jennifer to Christopher, Charlotte, or any of the people on Emma's side.\n\nFor example, is there a relationship like \"Jennifer is X's descendant\" or something? No, only \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" is given.\n\nSimilarly, for Jennifer, no other mentions.\n\nSo it seems like the two lines are separate; there's no common ancestor or descendant between them.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other fact that might connect them.\n\nFor instance, look at \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — but Jennifer might be the same as someone else, but names are unique, I assume.\n\nIn lineage, names might be repeated, but probably we assume all names refer to distinct individuals unless specified.\n\nIn the list, all names seem distinct; for example, there's \"Jennifer\" and \"Anna\", etc.\n\nBut let's see if there's a person named Jennifer elsewhere.\n\nFor example, \"Jennifer\" is only mentioned in \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant.\"\n\nSimilarly, \"Joshua\" is mentioned: \"Joshua is Alice's ancestor\" and \"Joshua is Charlotte's descendant.\"\n\n\"Charlotte\" is mentioned: \"Joshua is Charlotte's descendant\" and \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Christopher\" is mentioned: \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor\" and also \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor\" — that's it for Christopher.\n\n\"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor\" — only that.\n\nSimilarly, \"Emma\" is only in \"Alice is Emma's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Alice\" is in \"Joshua is Alice's ancestor\" and \"Alice is Emma's ancestor.\"\n\nFor Austin: \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" and \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant.\"\n\n\"Anna\" is also in \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" and \"Anna is Austin's ancestor.\"\n\n\"Jennifer\" only in that one place.\n\nNow, is there any other relationship that might involve Jennifer or Anna?\n\nFor example, \"Jennifer\" might be related to other people, but from the list, no.\n\nPerhaps through \"Jennifer\" being part of a larger family, but no data.\n\nAnother thing: let's see if there's a common person in both chains.\n\nFor example, is Jennifer the same as Charlotte or something? But Charlotte is different; Charlotte is mentioned separately.\n\nSimilarly, all names seem distinct.\n\nPerhaps I should look for any connection.\n\nFor instance, \"Anna\" might be connected to something else.\n\n\"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — but that's all.\n\nThere's \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" and also \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\", but that's it.\n\nSimilarly, for Emma, no other direct links.\n\nBut let's see the option: \"Austin and Emma share a common descendant\" — but they are both ancestors or descendants, but for them to share a common descendant, it would mean there is someone who is descendant of both, but since they might not be related, it's unlikely.\n\nSimilarly, \"Austin is Emma's descendant\" — but from the chains, Austin is descendant of Jennifer, Emma is descendant of Alice, and no link, so probably not.\n\n\"Austin is Emma's ancestor\" — similarly, unlikely.\n\n\"Share a common ancestor\" — if there is a common ancestor, but from the data, no link.\n\n\"None of the above\" — that might be it.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any connection I missed.\n\nFor example, is there a relationship like \"Jennifer is X's descendant\" or something? No.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"Jennifer\" is the same as \"Jenny\" or something, but in the list, it's \"Jennifer\", and no other variations.\n\nAll names are given as is.\n\nLet's list all the people mentioned to see if there's overlap.\n\nBut that might take time, but for the sake of it.\n\nPeople related to Emma: Emma, Alice, Joshua, Charlotte, Christopher.\n\nFrom the chain: Christopher, Charlotte, Joshua, Alice, Emma.\n\nPeople related to Austin: Austin, Anna, Jennifer.\n\nNow, is Jennifer in the first list? No.\n\nIs Anna in the first list? No.\n\nIs Jennifer related to Christopher? No data.\n\nFor example, is there \"Christopher is Jennifer's ancestor\" or something? No.\n\nSimilarly, \"Jennifer is Charlotte's descendant\" — not stated.\n\nSo no connection.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other fact that might connect.\n\nFor instance, look at \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — but Jennifer might be a descendant of someone else.\n\nBut no data.\n\nPerhaps through \"Jennifer\" being part of another chain.\n\nFor example, is there \"Jennifer\" in other relationships?\n\nThe list has: \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant.\" That's the only one.\n\nSimilarly, for \"Jennifer\", no other mentions.\n\nSimilarly, for \"Austin\", only \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" and that's it for Austin directly, but Anna is connected.\n\nBut Anna is only in \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" and \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\".\n\nSo the only people for Austin's side are Jennifer, Anna, Austin.\n\nFor Emma's side: Christopher, Charlotte, Joshua, Alice, Emma.\n\nNo overlap.\n\nTherefore, there is no direct or indirect relationship between Austin and Emma based on the given data.\n\nSo they don't share a common descendant, one is not the descendant of the other, and they don't share a common ancestor because there's no path.\n\nTherefore, \"none of the above\" should be correct.\n\nBut let's confirm the options.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Austin and Emma share a common descendant. — But for that, there would need to be someone who is descendant of both, but since no relation, impossible.\n\n2. Austin is Emma's descendant. — That would mean Emma is ancestor of Austin, but from chains, Austin is descendant of Jennifer, Emma is descendant of Alice, no link.\n\n3. Austin is Emma's ancestor. — Similarly, Emma would be descendant of Austin, but not the case.\n\n4. Austin and Emma share a common ancestor. — For that, there must be a person who is ancestor of both, but no common person in the chains.\n\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nSince 1,2,3,4 are all false, then 5 should be correct.\n\nBut is there a possibility I missed something?\n\nFor example, is there a relationship that involves both?\n\nLet's scan the list for \"Austin\" or \"Emma\".\n\nAustin: only \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" — that's it.\n\nEmma: only \"Alice is Emma's ancestor\" — that's it.\n\nNo other mentions.\n\nAnna: \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" and \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\"\n\nJennifer: only \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\"\n\nFor Emma: Alice is mentioned, and Alice has \"Joshua is Alice's ancestor\" and \"Alice is Emma's ancestor\"\n\nJoshua: \"Joshua is Alice's ancestor\" and \"Joshua is Charlotte's descendant\"\n\nCharlotte: \"Joshua is Charlotte's descendant\" and \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor\"\n\nChristopher: \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor\" — only that.\n\nSo no connection to Jennifer or Anna.\n\nPerhaps Jennifer is the same as someone else, but names are different.\n\nFor example, is \"Jennifer\" listed elsewhere? Let's see the full list.\n\nThe list has: \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant.\" — that's the only \"Jennifer\".\n\nSimilarly, \"Jennifer\" doesn't appear in any other context.\n\nFor instance, \"Jennifer\" is not in \"X is Jennifer's descendant\" or anything.\n\nSo yes, Jennifer is only defined as the ancestor of Anna.\n\nSimilarly, for the Emma side, all are defined within their chain.\n\nTherefore, no relationship between the two.\n\nSo Austin and Emma have no lineage relationship based on the given data.\n\nThus, none of the options 1-4 are correct, so 5 is the answer.\n\nBut let's see the options again.\n\nOption 4 is \"Austin and Emma share a common ancestor\" — but if they have no common ancestor, that's false.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps in a broader sense, but from data, no.\n\nAnother thought: maybe \"common ancestor\" could be very distant, but since no connection, it's not shared.\n\nFor example, if the family tree is disconnected, they don't share any common ancestor.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps I should check if there is any indirect link through other people.\n\nFor example, is there a person who is related to both sides?\n\nBut from the data, no.\n\nLet's see if Jennifer is mentioned in another way.\n\nFor instance, \"Jennifer\" might be \"Jenny\" but it's written as \"Jennifer\", and no other \"Jenny\".\n\nSimilarly, all names are specific.\n\nPerhaps \"Anna\" and \"Jennifer\" but no.\n\nAnother idea: look at \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — but Jennifer could be part of the Emma side, but no evidence.\n\nFor example, is there \"Jennifer is Charlotte's descendant\" or something? Not stated.\n\nSimilarly, \"Christopher is Jennifer's ancestor\" — not stated.\n\nSo I think it's safe to say no relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 5. None of the above is correct.\n\nBut let's see the answer choices: \"5. None of the above is correct.\"\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I misread a relationship.\n\nFor example, is there \"Austin\" mentioned elsewhere?\n\nLet's search the list for \"Austin\".\n\n\"Anna is Austin's ancestor.\" — that's the only one.\n\nSimilarly for \"Emma\": \"Alice is Emma's ancestor.\" — only one.\n\nNow, \"Anna\" is also in \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — but Jennifer not elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps \"Jennifer\" is a typo or something, but I think not.\n\nAnother thing: in the list, there is \"Jennifer\" but also \"Jenny\" is not there, so it's fine.\n\nPerhaps through \"Anna\" being related to something else.\n\nFor example, is there \"Anna is X's descendant\" for other X? Only Jennifer.\n\nSimilarly, \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" — only that.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for Emma, \"Alice is Emma's ancestor\" and Alice might be connected, but Alice is only in that chain.\n\nFor instance, \"Alice\" is not mentioned elsewhere, so no.\n\nSimilarly, all seem isolated.\n\nBut let's check if there is a common person in the entire list.\n\nFor example, is there a person who appears in both sides?\n\nLike, for instance, \"Charlotte\" is only on Emma side, \"Christopher\" only there, etc.\n\n\"Jennifer\" only on Austin side.\n\nSo no overlap.\n\nTherefore, no relationship.\n\nSo answer should be 5.\n\nBut let's see the options; option 5 says \"None of the above is correct.\" which includes that none of 1-4 are true.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if they share a common descendant, but since they are not related, there is no common descendant.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.\n","reasoning_details":[{"format":null,"index":0,"type":"reasoning.text","text":"First, I need to find the lineage relationship between Austin and Emma.

No.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"Jennifer\" is the same as \"Jenny\" or something, but in the list, it's \"Jennifer\", and no other variations.\n\nAll names are given as is.\n\nLet's list all the people mentioned to see if there's overlap.\n\nBut that might take time, but for the sake of it.\n\nPeople related to Emma: Emma, Alice, Joshua, Charlotte, Christopher.\n\nFrom the chain: Christopher, Charlotte, Joshua, Alice, Emma.\n\nPeople related to Austin: Austin, Anna, Jennifer.\n\nNow, is Jennifer in the first list? No.\n\nIs Anna in the first list? No.\n\nIs Jennifer related to Christopher? No data.\n\nFor example, is there \"Christopher is Jennifer's ancestor\" or something? No.\n\nSimilarly, \"Jennifer is Charlotte's descendant\" — not stated.\n\nSo no connection.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other fact that might connect.\n\nFor instance, look at \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — but Jennifer might be a descendant of someone else.\n\nBut no data.\n\nPerhaps through \"Jennifer\" being part of another chain.\n\nFor example, is there \"Jennifer\" in other relationships?\n\nThe list has: \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant.\" That's the only one.\n\nSimilarly, for \"Jennifer\", no other mentions.\n\nSimilarly, for \"Austin\", only \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" and that's it for Austin directly, but Anna is connected.\n\nBut Anna is only in \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" and \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\".\n\nSo the only people for Austin's side are Jennifer, Anna, Austin.\n\nFor Emma's side: Christopher, Charlotte, Joshua, Alice, Emma.\n\nNo overlap.\n\nTherefore, there is no direct or indirect relationship between Austin and Emma based on the given data.\n\nSo they don't share a common descendant, one is not the descendant of the other, and they don't share a common ancestor because there's no path.\n\nTherefore, \"none of the above\" should be correct.\n\nBut let's confirm the options.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Austin and Emma share a common descendant. — But for that, there would need to be someone who is descendant of both, but since no relation, impossible.\n\n2. Austin is Emma's descendant. — That would mean Emma is ancestor of Austin, but from chains, Austin is descendant of Jennifer, Emma is descendant of Alice, no link.\n\n3. Austin is Emma's ancestor. — Similarly, Emma would be descendant of Austin, but not the case.\n\n4. Austin and Emma share a common ancestor. — For that, there must be a person who is ancestor of both, but no common person in the chains.\n\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nSince 1,2,3,4 are all false, then 5 should be correct.\n\nBut is there a possibility I missed something?\n\nFor example, is there a relationship that involves both?\n\nLet's scan the list for \"Austin\" or \"Emma\".\n\nAustin: only \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" — that's it.\n\nEmma: only \"Alice is Emma's ancestor\" — that's it.\n\nNo other mentions.\n\nAnna: \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" and \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\"\n\nJennifer: only \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\"\n\nFor Emma: Alice is mentioned, and Alice has \"Joshua is Alice's ancestor\" and \"Alice is Emma's ancestor\"\n\nJoshua: \"Joshua is Alice's ancestor\" and \"Joshua is Charlotte's descendant\"\n\nCharlotte: \"Joshua is Charlotte's descendant\" and \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor\"\n\nChristopher: \"Christopher is Charlotte's ancestor\" — only that.\n\nSo no connection to Jennifer or Anna.\n\nPerhaps Jennifer is the same as someone else, but names are different.\n\nFor example, is \"Jennifer\" listed elsewhere? Let's see the full list.\n\nThe list has: \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant.\" — that's the only \"Jennifer\".\n\nSimilarly, \"Jennifer\" doesn't appear in any other context.\n\nFor instance, \"Jennifer\" is not in \"X is Jennifer's descendant\" or anything.\n\nSo yes, Jennifer is only defined as the ancestor of Anna.\n\nSimilarly, for the Emma side, all are defined within their chain.\n\nTherefore, no relationship between the two.\n\nSo Austin and Emma have no lineage relationship based on the given data.\n\nThus, none of the options 1-4 are correct, so 5 is the answer.\n\nBut let's see the options again.\n\nOption 4 is \"Austin and Emma share a common ancestor\" — but if they have no common ancestor, that's false.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps in a broader sense, but from data, no.\n\nAnother thought: maybe \"common ancestor\" could be very distant, but since no connection, it's not shared.\n\nFor example, if the family tree is disconnected, they don't share any common ancestor.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps I should check if there is any indirect link through other people.\n\nFor example, is there a person who is related to both sides?\n\nBut from the data, no.\n\nLet's see if Jennifer is mentioned in another way.\n\nFor instance, \"Jennifer\" might be \"Jenny\" but it's written as \"Jennifer\", and no other \"Jenny\".\n\nSimilarly, all names are specific.\n\nPerhaps \"Anna\" and \"Jennifer\" but no.\n\nAnother idea: look at \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — but Jennifer could be part of the Emma side, but no evidence.\n\nFor example, is there \"Jennifer is Charlotte's descendant\" or something? Not stated.\n\nSimilarly, \"Christopher is Jennifer's ancestor\" — not stated.\n\nSo I think it's safe to say no relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 5. None of the above is correct.\n\nBut let's see the answer choices: \"5. None of the above is correct.\"\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I misread a relationship.\n\nFor example, is there \"Austin\" mentioned elsewhere?\n\nLet's search the list for \"Austin\".\n\n\"Anna is Austin's ancestor.\" — that's the only one.\n\nSimilarly for \"Emma\": \"Alice is Emma's ancestor.\" — only one.\n\nNow, \"Anna\" is also in \"Anna is Jennifer's descendant\" — but Jennifer not elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps \"Jennifer\" is a typo or something, but I think not.\n\nAnother thing: in the list, there is \"Jennifer\" but also \"Jenny\" is not there, so it's fine.\n\nPerhaps through \"Anna\" being related to something else.\n\nFor example, is there \"Anna is X's descendant\" for other X? Only Jennifer.\n\nSimilarly, \"Anna is Austin's ancestor\" — only that.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for Emma, \"Alice is Emma's ancestor\" and Alice might be connected, but Alice is only in that chain.\n\nFor instance, \"Alice\" is not mentioned elsewhere, so no.\n\nSimilarly, all seem isolated.\n\nBut let's check if there is a common person in the entire list.\n\nFor example, is there a person who appears in both sides?\n\nLike, for instance, \"Charlotte\" is only on Emma side, \"Christopher\" only there, etc.\n\n\"Jennifer\" only on Austin side.\n\nSo no overlap.\n\nTherefore, no relationship.\n\nSo answer should be 5.\n\nBut let's see the options; option 5 says \"None of the above is correct.\" which includes that none of 1-4 are true.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if they share a common descendant, but since they are not related, there is no common descendant.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.\n"}]}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1453,"total_tokens":5546,"completion_tokens":4093,"prompt_tokens_details":null,"reasoning_tokens":0}}
