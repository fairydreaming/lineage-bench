- Ruth is Carol's ancestor, and Carol is Deborah's ancestor. Thus, **Ruth → Carol → Deborah**.
- Deborah is Alexander's ancestor, and Alexander is Zachary's ancestor. Thus, **Deborah → Alexander → Zachary**.
- Zachary is Barbara's ancestor, and Joyce is Barbara's ancestor. Joyce must be in Zachary's lineage (e.g., Zachary, Alexander, Deborah, Carol, or Ruth).
- Larry is Joyce's ancestor. If Joyce is in the line **Deborah → Alexander → Zachary → Barbara**, Larry must be higher in this lineage. Since **Carol → Deborah**, and **Ruth → Carol**, Ruth is the earliest ancestor in this chain.

**Conclusion:**
Ruth is the ancestor of Carol, who is the ancestor of Deborah. Deborah is part of the lineage leading to Barbara, whose ancestor Joyce is linked to Larry. Since Larry is Joyce's ancestor and Joyce is part of the lineage descending from Ruth, **Ruth is Larry's ancestor**.
