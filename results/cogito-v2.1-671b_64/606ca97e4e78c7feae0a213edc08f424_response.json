This is a bit complex, so I'll need to map out the connections step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the relationships that involve Arthur and Judith to see if there's a direct connection or if I need to find a common link.\n\nFrom the given:\n- Arthur is Kimberly's descendant. (Arthur is a descendant of Kimberly)\n- Kimberly is Denise's descendant. (So Kimberly is a descendant of Denise)\n- Shirley is Denise's ancestor. (So Shirley is an ancestor of Denise, meaning Denise is a descendant of Shirley)\n- Shirley is Julie's descendant. (Wait, that says Shirley is Julie's descendant, but that might conflict. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, no: \"Shirley is Julie's descendant\" means Shirley is a descendant of Julie. But earlier, \"Shirley is Denise's ancestor\" means Shirley is an ancestor of Denise. So Julie -> Shirley -> Denise -> Kimberly -> Arthur. So Arthur is a descendant of Kimberly, who is a descendant of Denise, who is a descendant of Shirley, who is a descendant of Julie. So the line is Julie -> Shirley -> Denise -> Kimberly -> Arthur.\n\nNow, what about Judith? The only mention is: \"Judith is Sara's ancestor.\" So Judith is an ancestor of Sara. Also, \"Sara is Harold's ancestor,\" so Sara is an ancestor of Harold. And \"Harold is Jacob's ancestor.\" So Judith -> Sara -> Harold -> Jacob.\n\nNow, is there any connection between Arthur's line and Judith's line?

Therefore, Arthur is Judith's descendant.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any break in the chain. Starting from Judith:\n\n1. Judith is Sara's ancestor.\n2. Sara is Harold's ancestor.\n3. Harold is Jacob's ancestor.\n4. Jacob is Amy's ancestor (since Amy is Jacob's descendant).\n5. Amy is Jason's ancestor.\n6. Jason is Maria's ancestor.\n7.

Julie is Shirley's ancestor (since Shirley is Julie's descendant).\n61. Shirley is Denise's ancestor.\n62. Denise is Kimberly's ancestor (since Kimberly is Denise's descendant).\n63. Kimberly is Arthur's ancestor.\n\nSo yes, Judith is an ancestor of Arthur, meaning Arthur is Judith's descendant. Therefore, the correct answer should be option 3: Arthur is Judith's descendant.\n\nBut let me check if there's any possibility that this isn't the case. For example, if there were any breaks or contradictions, but from the chain above, it seems all the relationships connect properly. \n\nAlso, note that some relationships might have multiple paths, but in this case, the chain seems consistent.
