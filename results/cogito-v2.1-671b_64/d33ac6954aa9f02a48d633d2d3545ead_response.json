Cheryl has Janice as a descendant.\n61. Janice has James as a descendant.\n62. James has Nicole as a descendant.\n63. Nicole has Victoria as a descendant.\n\nThis is a very long chain, but it shows that Isabella is an ancestor of Victoria. Therefore, Victoria is Isabella's descendant.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n1. Victoria and Isabella share a common descendant. - This would mean they have a common descendant, but actually, one is the ancestor of the other.\n2. Victoria is Isabella's descendant. - This matches our finding.\n3. Victoria is Isabella's ancestor. - This would be the opposite.\n4.
