The relationship \"Evelyn is Shirley's descendant\" means Shirley is an ancestor of Evelyn. Then \"Theresa is Evelyn's descendant\" means Evelyn is an ancestor of Theresa. So Shirley -> Evelyn -> Theresa -> ... -> Madison. So Shirley is an ancestor of Madison, which means Madison is a descendant of Shirley.\n\nBut the question is about the relationship between Madison and Shirley. If Madison is Shirley's descendant, then Shirley is Madison's ancestor. So the correct answer would be that Madison is Shirley's descendant.\n\nLooking at the options:\n1.

Madison and Shirley share a common descendant. (Not necessarily)\n5. None of the above is correct.\n\nSo option 2 seems correct.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no other connection. The entire chain seems to connect Madison back to Shirley through the lineage. I don't see any other paths that would suggest a different relationship.
