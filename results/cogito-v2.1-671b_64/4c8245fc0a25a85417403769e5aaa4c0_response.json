This seems like a complex family tree problem, so I'll need to map out the connections step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the relationships and see if I can find a path from Judy to Katherine or vice versa, or if they share a common ancestor or descendant.\n\nStarting with Judy:\n- Anna is Nicholas's ancestor, and Anna is Judy's descendant.

Starting from Judy, we have Anna as Judy's descendant, then Nicholas as Anna's descendant, and so on.
