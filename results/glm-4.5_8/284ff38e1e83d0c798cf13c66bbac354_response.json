There are several relationships given, and I need to figure out how Joe and Rebecca are related. The options are about whether one is the ancestor or descendant of the other, if they share a common ancestor, or a common descendant, or none of these.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the given relationships clearly:\n\n1. Jason is Samuel's descendant. So, Samuel is Jason's ancestor.\n\n2. Rebecca is Sophia's descendant. So, Sophia is Rebecca's ancestor.\n\n3. Gloria is Jason's descendant. So, Jason is Gloria's ancestor.\n\n4. Gloria is Joe's ancestor. So, Joe is Gloria's descendant.\n\n5. Barbara is Alan's descendant. So, Alan is Barbara's ancestor.\n\n6. Samuel is Alan's ancestor. So, Alan is Samuel's descendant.\n\n7. Sophia is Barbara's descendant. So, Barbara is Sophia's ancestor.\n\nNow, I need to connect Joe and Rebecca through these relationships.\n\nLet me start from Joe and work backwards or forwards to see if I can reach Rebecca.\n\nFrom point 4: Gloria is Joe's ancestor, so Joe is Gloria's descendant.\n\nFrom point 3: Gloria is Jason's descendant, so Jason is Gloria's ancestor, meaning Jason is also Joe's ancestor since Gloria is between them.\n\nIf Gloria is Jason's descendant, then Jason is Gloria's ancestor. And since Gloria is Joe's ancestor, that means Jason is also Joe's ancestor because ancestors are transitive. If A is ancestor of B, and B is ancestor of C, then A is ancestor of C.\n\nSimilarly for descendants.\n\nSo, from Joe: Gloria is ancestor, Jason is ancestor (since Jason ancestor of Gloria), and Samuel is ancestor of Jason? From point 1: Jason is Samuel's descendant, so Samuel is Jason's ancestor.\n\nPoint 1: Jason is Samuel's descendant → Samuel is Jason's ancestor.\n\nPoint 3: Gloria is Jason's descendant → Jason is Gloria's ancestor.\n\nPoint 4: Gloria is Joe's ancestor → Joe is Gloria's descendant.\n\nSo, combining: Samuel is ancestor of Jason, Jason is ancestor of Gloria, Gloria is ancestor of Joe, so Samuel is ancestor of Joe.\n\nSimilarly, Joe is descendant of Samuel.\n\nNow, let's look at Rebecca.\n\nPoint 2: Rebecca is Sophia's descendant → Sophia is Rebecca's ancestor.\n\nPoint 7: Sophia is Barbara's descendant → Barbara is Sophia's ancestor.\n\nPoint 5: Barbara is Alan's descendant → Alan is Barbara's ancestor.\n\nPoint 6: Samuel is Alan's ancestor → Alan is Samuel's descendant? Point 6: Samuel is Alan's ancestor, so Alan is Samuel's descendant.\n\nLet's write the ancestor-descendant chains.\n\nFirst, for Joe's side:\n\n- Samuel → Jason (since Samuel ancestor of Jason)\n\n- Jason → Gloria (Jason ancestor of Gloria)\n\n- Gloria → Joe (Gloria ancestor of Joe)\n\nSo, Samuel → Jason → Gloria → Joe\n\nTherefore, Samuel is ancestor of Joe.\n\nNow for Rebecca's side:\n\n- Sophia → Rebecca (Sophia ancestor of Rebecca)\n\n- Barbara → Sophia (Barbara ancestor of Sophia, from point 7)\n\n- Alan → Barbara (Alan ancestor of Barbara, from point 5)\n\n- Samuel → Alan (Samuel ancestor of Alan, from point 6)\n\nPoint 6: Samuel is Alan's ancestor, so Samuel → Alan\n\nPoint 5: Barbara is Alan's descendant, so Alan → Barbara\n\nPoint 7: Sophia is Barbara's descendant, so Barbara → Sophia\n\nPoint 2: Rebecca is Sophia's descendant, so Sophia → Rebecca\n\nTherefore, Samuel → Alan → Barbara → Sophia → Rebecca\n\nSo, Samuel is ancestor of Rebecca.\n\nNow, Samuel is ancestor of both Joe and Rebecca.\n\nTherefore, Joe and Rebecca share a common ancestor, which is Samuel.\n\nNow, let's see the options.\n\n1. Joe is Rebecca's descendant. Is that true? Not necessarily. They share a common ancestor, but we don't know if one is descendant of the other. From the chains, Joe is from Samuel through Jason and Gloria, Rebecca is from Samuel through Alan, Barbara, Sophia. So different paths, so Joe is not necessarily descendant of Rebecca or vice versa.\n\n2. Joe and Rebecca share a common ancestor. Yes, Samuel is a common ancestor.\n\n3. Joe is Rebecca's ancestor. Similarly, not necessarily.\n\n4. Joe and Rebecca share a common descendant. Do they? We don't have any information about descendants of Joe or Rebecca. The relationships given are all ancestors, not descendants except for Gloria being ancestor of Joe, but Joe has no descendants mentioned. Similarly for Rebecca. So we can't say they share a common descendant.\n\n5. None of the above.\n\nBut option 2 seems correct: they share a common ancestor.\n\nIs Samuel the only common ancestor? Well, there might be others, but at least Samuel is one.\n\nFor example, Alan is also an ancestor of Rebecca, and since Samuel is ancestor of Alan, Alan is also ancestor of Joe? Samuel is ancestor of Alan, and Alan is ancestor of Barbara, etc., down to Rebecca, but for Joe, Samuel is ancestor directly through Jason, but Alan might not be ancestor of Joe.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFrom Joe's side: ancestors are Samuel, Jason, Gloria.\n\nFrom Rebecca's side: ancestors are Samuel, Alan, Barbara, Sophia.\n\nSo common ancestors include Samuel, but Alan is not ancestor of Joe, because Joe's line is Samuel -> Jason -> Gloria -> Joe, no Alan involved.\n\nSimilarly, Jason is not ancestor of Rebecca; Rebecca's line is Samuel -> Alan -> Barbara -> Sophia -> Rebecca.\n\nSo only Samuel is the common ancestor here, I think.\n\nBut Samuel is common.\n\nNow, about sharing a common descendant: do Joe and Rebecca have a common descendant? We don't know. The relationships don't mention any descendants of Joe or Rebecca. Gloria is mentioned as ancestor of Joe, but Joe might have children or not, not specified. Similarly for Rebecca. So we cannot infer that they share a common descendant. Therefore, option 4 is not necessarily true.\n\nOption 1: Joe is Rebecca's descendant. But from the chains, Joe and Rebecca are both descendants of Samuel, but on different branches. Joe is not in Rebecca's lineage; Rebecca is not in Joe's. For example, Rebecca's ancestors include Alan, Barbara, Sophia, who are not ancestors of Joe. Joe's ancestors include Jason and Gloria, who are not ancestors of Rebecca. So Joe is not descendant of Rebecca, and Rebecca is not descendant of Joe.\n\nTherefore, only option 2 seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any connection I missed.\n\nIs there a way that Joe and Rebecca are directly related?\n\nFor example, is there a link between the two chains?\n\nThe chains are separate except for Samuel.\n\nSamuel is the root.\n\nNow, point 6: Samuel is Alan's ancestor, and point 1: Jason is Samuel's descendant, but no direct link between Alan and Jason.\n\nSimilarly, Barbara and Jason, etc.\n\nSo no, no other connections.\n\nTherefore, Joe and Rebecca are related only through Samuel as a common ancestor.\n\nHence, they share a common ancestor.\n\nNow, about option 4: share a common descendant.\n\nTo have a common descendant, there must be someone who is descendant of both Joe and Rebecca.\n\nBut we don't have any information about descendants of Joe or Rebecca. Gloria is ancestor of Joe, so Joe has an ancestor, but not descendants mentioned. Similarly, Rebecca has ancestors, but no descendants.\n\nMoreover, even if they had descendants, we don't know if there's a common one. For example, Joe might have children, Rebecca might have children, but unless they intermarry or something, which isn't suggested, we can't assume a common descendant.\n\nIn fact, since they are from different branches, it's possible they have no common descendants.\n\nBut the point is, based on given information, we cannot confirm that they share a common descendant, so option 4 is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, only option 2 is correct.\n\nBut let me see the answer choices again.\n\n1. Joe is Rebecca's descendant. — No, as above.\n\n2. Joe and Rebecca share a common ancestor. — Yes, Samuel.\n\n3. Joe is Rebecca's ancestor. — No.\n\n4. Joe and Rebecca share a common descendant. — Not necessarily, no information.\n\n5. None of the above. — But 2 is correct.\n\nSo it should be 2.\n\nBut is there a possibility that Samuel is not the only common ancestor? For example, if there were earlier ancestors, but we don't have information, so Samuel is a common ancestor, and that's sufficient.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if Joe and Rebecca could be the same person, but no, different names, so distinct.\n\nAnother thing: in the lineage, Gloria is Joe's ancestor, and Gloria is Jason's descendant, so Joe is descendant of Jason, etc.\n\nSimilarly for Rebecca.\n\nNo overlap.\n\nPerhaps I can draw a diagram mentally.\n\nStart with Samuel.\n\nSamuel has descendants: Jason (from point 1), and Alan (from point 6, Samuel ancestor of Alan).\n\nPoint 6: Samuel is Alan's ancestor, so Alan is descendant of Samuel.\n\nSimilarly, Jason is descendant of Samuel.\n\nNow, Jason has descendant Gloria (point 3).\n\nGloria has descendant Joe (point 4, Gloria ancestor of Joe).\n\nSo Samuel -> Jason -> Gloria -> Joe\n\nNow, Alan has descendant Barbara (point 5, Barbara is Alan's descendant, so Alan -> Barbara).\n\nBarbara has descendant Sophia (point 7, Sophia is Barbara's descendant, so Barbara -> Sophia).\n\nSophia has descendant Rebecca (point 2, Rebecca is Sophia's descendant, so Sophia -> Rebecca).\n\nSo Samuel -> Alan -> Barbara -> Sophia -> Rebecca\n\nNow, Joe and Rebecca are both descendants of Samuel, but not directly related otherwise.\n\nTherefore, they share a common ancestor, Samuel.\n\nSo answer should be 2.\n\nBut let me see if there's any trick.\n\nPoint 4: Gloria is Joe's ancestor. That means Joe is descendant of Gloria, so Gloria is above Joe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I misread the relationships.\n\n\"Jason is Samuel's descendant\" — so Samuel ancestor of Jason.\n\n\"Rebecca is Sophia's descendant\" — Sophia ancestor of Rebecca.\n\n\"Gloria is Jason's descendant\" — Jason ancestor of Gloria.\n\n\"Gloria is Joe's ancestor\" — Joe descendant of Gloria.\n\n\"Barbara is Alan's descendant\" — Alan ancestor of Barbara.\n\n\"Samuel is Alan's ancestor\" — Alan descendant of Samuel.\n\n\"Sophia is Barbara's descendant\" — Barbara ancestor of Sophia.\n\nAll clear.\n\nNow, from Samuel, two lines: one to Jason to Gloria to Joe, and one to Alan to Barbara to Sophia to Rebecca.\n\nNo connection between the two lines except at Samuel.\n\nTherefore, Joe and Rebecca share Samuel as a common ancestor.\n\nHence, option 2.\n\nBut option 2 says \"share a common ancestor,\" which is true.\n\nNow, is there any other common ancestor? For example, if Samuel had a parent, but not mentioned, so we don't know, but Samuel is sufficient.\n\nPerhaps Alan could be considered, but Alan is not ancestor of Joe, only of Rebecca.\n\nSimilarly, Jason not ancestor of Rebecca.\n\nSo only Samuel.\n\nTherefore, they share a common ancestor.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the question is to choose the correct statement, and 2 is correct.\n\nBut let me see why other options are wrong.\n\nOption 1: Joe is Rebecca's descendant. But Rebecca is descendant of Sophia, Barbara, Alan, Samuel. Joe is not in that line; Joe is from Jason's line. So no.\n\nSimilarly, option 3: Joe is Rebecca's ancestor. But Joe is descendant of Gloria, who is descendant of Jason, etc., so Joe is younger, not ancestor.\n\nIn terms of generations, Samuel is oldest, then Jason and Alan are probably siblings or something, but not specified, but Alan and Jason both descendants of Samuel, so same generation or different, but Joe is several generations below Samuel, Rebecca also below, but Joe might be closer or farther, but not ancestor of Rebecca.\n\nFor example, Samuel -> Jason -> Gloria -> Joe, so Joe is three generations below Samuel.\n\nSamuel -> Alan -> Barbara -> Sophia -> Rebecca, so Rebecca is four generations below Samuel, assuming each arrow is one generation.\n\nBut generations not specified, but in any case, Joe is not ancestor of Rebecca; Rebecca is not ancestor of Joe.\n\nOption 4: share a common descendant. But no descendants mentioned for Joe or Rebecca. Gloria is ancestor of Joe, so Joe has no descendants mentioned. Similarly, Rebecca has no descendants mentioned. So we cannot say they share a common descendant. It might be possible, but not from given information, so not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, only option 2 is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 2.\n\nBut let me see the options again.\n\n\"2.
