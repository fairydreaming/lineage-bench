There are several relationships given, and I need to find out how Frances and Janet are related. The options are about whether one is an ancestor or descendant of the other, or if they share a common ancestor or descendant, or none of the above.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the given relationships clearly:\n\n1. Janet is Michael's ancestor. That means Janet → Michael (Janet is above Michael in the family tree).\n\n2. Frances is Nicholas's descendant. So, Nicholas → Frances (Nicholas is above Frances).\n\n3. Nicholas is Andrea's descendant. So, Andrea → Nicholas.\n\n4. Jason is Dorothy's ancestor. Jason → Dorothy.\n\n5. Michael is Jason's ancestor. Michael → Jason.\n\n6. Theresa is Dorothy's descendant. Dorothy → Theresa.\n\n7. Andrea is Theresa's descendant. Theresa → Andrea.\n\nI need to be careful with the direction. When it says \"A is B's ancestor,\" it means A is above B, so A → B. Similarly, \"A is B's descendant\" means B is above A, so B → A.\n\nLet me rewrite all with arrows to make it easier:\n\n- Janet → Michael (Janet is ancestor of Michael)\n\n- Nicholas → Frances (Frances is descendant of Nicholas, so Nicholas is ancestor)\n\n- Andrea → Nicholas (Nicholas is descendant of Andrea, so Andrea is ancestor)\n\n- Jason → Dorothy (Jason is ancestor of Dorothy)\n\n- Michael → Jason (Michael is ancestor of Jason)\n\n- Dorothy → Theresa (Theresa is descendant of Dorothy, so Dorothy is ancestor)\n\n- Theresa → Andrea (Andrea is descendant of Theresa, so Theresa is ancestor)\n\nNow, I need to connect Frances and Janet.\n\nFirst, let's see the chain for Frances.\n\nFrom Frances:\n\nFrances ← Nicholas (since Nicholas is ancestor)\n\nNicholas ← Andrea (Andrea is ancestor)\n\nAndrea ← Theresa (Theresa is ancestor)\n\nTheresa ← Dorothy (Dorothy is ancestor)\n\nDorothy ← Jason (Jason is ancestor)\n\nJason ← Michael (Michael is ancestor)\n\nMichael ← Janet (Janet is ancestor)\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nJanet → Michael → Jason → Dorothy → Theresa → Andrea → Nicholas → Frances\n\nThat seems like a straight line from Janet down to Frances.\n\nLet me write the chain:\n\nStart from Frances: Frances is descendant of Nicholas, so Nicholas → Frances\n\nNicholas is descendant of Andrea, so Andrea → Nicholas\n\nAndrea is descendant of Theresa, so Theresa → Andrea\n\nTheresa is descendant of Dorothy, so Dorothy → Theresa\n\nDorothy is descendant of Jason? No.\n\nJason is ancestor of Dorothy, so Jason → Dorothy\n\nThen, Michael is ancestor of Jason, so Michael → Jason\n\nJanet is ancestor of Michael, so Janet → Michael\n\nSo, the chain is:\n\nJanet → Michael → Jason → Dorothy → Theresa → Andrea → Nicholas → Frances\n\nYes, so Janet is an ancestor of Frances.\n\nTherefore, Frances is Janet's descendant.\n\nNow, let me check if all connections are there.\n\nFrom the relationships:\n\n- Janet → Michael (given)\n\n- Michael → Jason (given)\n\n- Jason → Dorothy (given)\n\n- Dorothy → Theresa? Theresa is Dorothy's descendant, so Dorothy → Theresa, yes.\n\n- Theresa → Andrea? Andrea is Theresa's descendant, so Theresa → Andrea, yes.\n\n- Andrea → Nicholas? Nicholas is Andrea's descendant, so Andrea → Nicholas, yes.\n\n- Nicholas → Frances? Frances is Nicholas's descendant, so Nicholas → Frances, yes.\n\nSo, all connected in a direct line: Janet → Michael → Jason → Dorothy → Theresa → Andrea → Nicholas → Frances\n\nTherefore, Frances is a descendant of Janet.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n1. Frances is Janet's descendant.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nBut let me see the other options to make sure.\n\n2. Frances and Janet share a common descendant.\n\nWell, since Frances is a descendant of Janet, they share common descendants, but specifically, Frances herself is a descendant, so yes, but option 1 is more direct.\n\nThe question is about the relationship between them, and option 1 is straightforward.\n\n3. Frances and Janet share a common ancestor.\n\nDo they? In this chain, Janet is at the top, so Janet has no ancestor mentioned, and Frances has ancestors, but they might share a common ancestor if there is someone above Janet, but no information about that.\n\nIn this chain, Janet is the highest, so no common ancestor is indicated. They are directly related, so they don't necessarily share a common ancestor unless there is branching, but here it's a straight line.\n\nSince it's a direct line, Janet is an ancestor, so Frances is descendant, and they don't share a common ancestor because Janet is the ancestor.\n\nFor example, in a family tree, if A is parent of B, then B is descendant of A, and they don't share a common ancestor; A is the ancestor.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\n4. Frances is Janet's ancestor. That would be the opposite, which is not true.\n\n5. None of the above.\n\nBut option 1 seems correct.\n\nIn the chain, I have Janet at the top and Frances at the bottom, so Frances is descendant of Janet.\n\nBut let me double-check the relationships to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Janet is Michael's ancestor: Janet → Michael\n\n- Frances is Nicholas's descendant: Nicholas → Frances\n\n- Nicholas is Andrea's descendant: Andrea → Nicholas\n\n- Jason is Dorothy's ancestor: Jason → Dorothy\n\n- Michael is Jason's ancestor: Michael → Jason\n\n- Theresa is Dorothy's descendant: Dorothy → Theresa\n\n- Andrea is Theresa's descendant: Theresa → Andrea\n\nNow, from Andrea → Nicholas and Nicholas → Frances, so Andrea → Nicholas → Frances\n\nFrom Theresa → Andrea, so Theresa → Andrea → Nicholas → Frances\n\nFrom Dorothy → Theresa, so Dorothy → Theresa → Andrea → Nicholas → Frances\n\nFrom Jason → Dorothy, so Jason → Dorothy → Theresa → Andrea → Nicholas → Frances\n\nFrom Michael → Jason, so Michael → Jason → Dorothy → Theresa → Andrea → Nicholas → Frances\n\nFrom Janet → Michael, so Janet → Michael → Jason → Dorothy → Theresa → Andrea → Nicholas → Frances\n\nYes, all connected.\n\nI could start from Janet and go down.\n\nJanet → Michael\n\nMichael → Jason\n\nJason → Dorothy\n\nNow, Dorothy → Theresa (since Theresa is descendant)\n\nTheresa → Andrea (Andrea is descendant)\n\nAndrea → Nicholas (Nicholas is descendant)\n\nNicholas → Frances (Frances is descendant)\n\nSame thing.\n\nNow, is there any other relationship that might complicate this?\n\nFor example, is there a possibility that there are multiple paths or something?\n\nBut from the given, it seems all are in one line.\n\nLet me list all the people: Janet, Michael, Frances, Nicholas, Andrea, Jason, Dorothy, Theresa.\n\nFrom the chain, all are connected in order.\n\nPerhaps I can think in terms of generations.\n\nAssume each arrow is one generation, but it might not be, but for relationship, it doesn't matter.\n\nSo, Janet is ancestor of Frances, so Frances is descendant of Janet.\n\nTherefore, option 1 should be correct.\n\nBut let me see why other options might be tempting.\n\nOption 2: share a common descendant. Well, since Frances is descendant, and Janet is ancestor, any descendant of Frances is also descendant of Janet, so they share common descendants, but the relationship between Frances and Janet is that one is ancestor and one is descendant, so option 1 is more precise.\n\nThe question is to determine the lineage relationship between Frances and Janet, and option 1 directly states it.\n\nOption 3: share a common ancestor. But in this case, since Janet is an ancestor, and no one above, they don't share a common ancestor. If there was someone above both, but here Janet is the highest.\n\nFor example, if Janet had a parent, but no information, so we can't assume that.\n\nSimilarly, option 4 is wrong.\n\nSo, I think option 1 is correct.\n\nBut let me see the answer choices again.\n\n1. Frances is Janet's descendant.\n\n2. Frances and Janet share a common descendant.\n\n3. Frances and Janet share a common ancestor.\n\n4. Frances is Janet's ancestor.\n\n5. None of the above.\n\nNow, since Frances is directly descendant, 1 is true.\n\nBut is there any trick?\n\nOne thing: in the relationships, Andrea is Theresa's descendant, and Theresa is Dorothy's descendant, etc.\n\nBut in the chain, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if all are distinct or something, but no issue.\n\nMaybe I can write the family tree.\n\nLet me sketch:\n\nTop: Janet\n\n↓\n\nMichael\n\n↓\n\nJason\n\n↓\n\nDorothy\n\n↓\n\nTheresa\n\n↓\n\nAndrea\n\n↓\n\nNicholas\n\n↓\n\nFrances\n\nYes, clear.\n\nSo, Frances is descendant of Janet.\n\nTherefore, answer should be 1.\n\nBut the problem is to select the correct answer, and it says \"enclose the selected answer number\".\n\nBut let me see if there is any mistake.\n\nAnother thing: in the given, it says \"Frances is Nicholas's descendant\" which I have as Nicholas → Frances.\n\nSimilarly, \"Nicholas is Andrea's descendant\" so Andrea → Nicholas.\n\n\"Andrea is Theresa's descendant\" so Theresa → Andrea.\n\n\"Theresa is Dorothy's descendant\" so Dorothy → Theresa.\n\n\"Jason is Dorothy's ancestor\" so Jason → Dorothy.\n\n\"Michael is Jason's ancestor\" so Michael → Jason.\n\n\"Janet is Michael's ancestor\" so Janet → Michael.\n\nAll consistent.\n\nPerhaps I can think from Frances up to Janet.\n\nFrances ← Nicholas (ancestor)\n\nNicholas ← Andrea (ancestor)\n\nAndrea ← Theresa (ancestor)\n\nTheresa ← Dorothy (ancestor)\n\nDorothy ← Jason (ancestor)\n\nJason ← Michael (ancestor)\n\nMichael ← Janet (ancestor)\n\nSo, Frances has ancestors: Nicholas, Andrea, Theresa, Dorothy, Jason, Michael, Janet.\n\nJanet is the most distant ancestor.\n\nSo, definitely, Frances is Janet's descendant.\n\nTherefore, no doubt.\n\nSo, I think it's straightforward.\n\nBut why is there option 5?
