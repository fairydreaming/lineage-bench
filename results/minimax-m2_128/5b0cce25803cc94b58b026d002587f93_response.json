The problem gives a large list of pairwise relationships indicating ancestor/descendant relationships.

So Grace is descendant of Gloria.\n\nNow Janice: \"Janice is Nicholas's descendant.\" So Janice is descendant of Nicholas.\n\nWe need to see if there is a connection between Janice and Grace via ancestors/descendants.\n\nWe need to see if there is a path linking Janice to Grace: either Janice is ancestor of Grace, or Grace is ancestor of Janice, or they share a common ancestor, or share a common descendant.\n\nWe need to parse the graph.\n\nWe'll need to construct a directed graph where edges represent \"X is ancestor of Y\" (X -> Y) or \"X is descendant of Y\" (X -> Y? Actually if X is Y's ancestor, then X -> Y. If X is Y's descendant, then Y -> X). Let's define direction: Represent \"X is ancestor of Y\" as an edge from X to Y (X -> Y). So \"X is descendant of Y\" is edge from Y to X.\n\nThus each relationship can be expressed as directed edge.\n\nGoal: Determine relationship between Janice and Grace: Are they in same chain? If Janice is ancestor of Grace (i.e., Janice -> ... -> Grace). Or Grace is ancestor of Janice (Grace -> ... -> Janice). Or they share a common ancestor (i.e., there exists some node that is ancestor of both). Or they share a common descendant (i.e., some node that is descendant of both). Or none.\n\nWe need to examine all relationships.\n\nGiven many relationships, it's possible that Janice and Grace are related indirectly via some chain.\n\nWe need to find any chain linking Janice to Grace.\n\nLet's parse all relationships and build the graph.\n\nWe'll list each person and their known ancestors/descendants.\n\nGiven the large number, we can attempt to build a full genealogical graph. However, we need to be careful about cycles? Might be none. The relationships are all ancestor/descendant, which should be acyclic if consistent. However, there may be contradictory relationships? Possibly not. But we need to verify.\n\nGiven the number of individuals, we can try to map all relationships. Let's start by listing each relationship as a directed edge.\n\nWe'll parse each bullet:\n\n1. Amber is Megan's ancestor. Edge: Amber -> Megan.\n\n2. Kathleen is Kyle's descendant. Means Kyle is ancestor of Kathleen? Wait \"Kathleen is Kyle's descendant.\" Means Kathleen is descendant of Kyle. So edge: Kyle -> Kathleen.\n\n3. Emma is Frances's ancestor.

Edge: Sharon -> Diana.\n\n127. Nicholas is Shirley's descendant. Edge: Shirley -> Nicholas.\n\nThese are all relationships.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Janice and Grace.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Janice is Nicholas's descendant: Edge: Nicholas -> Janice.\n\n- Grace: Gloria is Grace's ancestor: Edge: Gloria -> Grace.\n\nThus Janice is descendant of Nicholas. Grace is descendant of Gloria.\n\nWe need to see if there is any path linking Nicholas to Gloria (or Gloria to Nicholas) or any common ancestor/descendant.\n\nThus we need to examine the genealogical tree(s) to see if Nicholas and Gloria are connected.\n\nLet's list the graph edges for each person.\n\nWe'll need to consider all relationships. Then we can find the ancestors/descendants for Nicholas and Gloria. Then check if they intersect.\n\nGiven the large number of relationships, we need to systematically compute the ancestry and descendant sets.\n\nApproach: Use a systematic method: Build adjacency lists for each person (both ancestors and descendants). Then compute transitive closure.\n\nBut manually? Could be huge. However, we can try to find connections by focusing on relevant persons.\n\nWe need to find any path linking Nicholas to Gloria, or Janice to Grace.\n\nGrace is descendant of Gloria. So any ancestor of Gloria is also ancestor of Grace (if we go upward). Also any descendant of Grace is also descendant of Gloria.\n\nJanice is descendant of Nicholas. So any ancestor of Janice is also ancestor of Nicholas (if we go upward). Also any descendant of Janice is descendant of Nicholas.\n\nThus to see if Janice is ancestor/descendant of Grace, we need to see if there is a path from Janice to Grace (Janice -> ... -> Grace) or Grace -> ... -> Janice.\n\nThus we need to see if there is a chain connecting Nicholas and Gloria.\n\nThus find if there is any path from Nicholas to Gloria (or Gloria to Nicholas). If there is a path, then Janice (descendant of Nicholas) and Grace (descendant of Gloria) might be related.\n\nBut careful: If there is a path from Nicholas to Gloria, then Janice (descendant of Nicholas) might be ancestor of Grace? Actually if Nicholas is ancestor of Gloria (Nicholas -> ... -> Gloria), then any descendant of Nicholas (including Janice) is also ancestor of Gloria? Wait, if Nicholas is ancestor of Gloria, then Nicholas is above Gloria. So Janice is descendant of Nicholas, thus Janice is also descendant of Nicholas but could be above or below Gloria? Let's think.\n\nIf we have a directed graph where edges go ancestor -> descendant. So if we have a path from X to Y (X->...->Y), then X is ancestor of Y (higher) and Y is descendant of X (lower). So if we have a path from Nicholas to Gloria (Nicholas -> ... -> Gloria), then Nicholas is ancestor of Gloria, and Gloria is descendant of Nicholas.\n\nThus Janice is descendant of Nicholas, but Janice could be anywhere in the subtree of Nicholas. Could Janice be an ancestor of Gloria? No, because Janice is descendant of Nicholas, which is ancestor of Gloria. So Janice is lower than Nicholas. Since Gloria is descendant of Nicholas, Gloria is also lower than Nicholas. So Janice and Gloria are both in the subtree of Nicholas, but we need to see if Janice is ancestor of Gloria (i.e., Janice is above Gloria in the tree) or descendant of Gloria (i.e., Janice is below Gloria). If Janice is descendant of Nicholas but not descendant of Gloria, then Janice is not ancestor of Grace. However, there might be a path from Janice to Gloria (if Janice is ancestor of Gloria). That would require Janice to be above Gloria (i.e., Janice is an ancestor of Gloria). Since Janice is descendant of Nicholas, which is ancestor of Gloria, it's possible that Janice is also ancestor of Gloria if Janice is on the path between Nicholas and Gloria. But if Janice is lower than Nicholas and also lower than Gloria, then Janice cannot be ancestor of Gloria. Actually, if Nicholas is ancestor of Gloria, then the path from Nicholas to Gloria goes downwards. Janice is descendant of Nicholas but could be on that path (i.e., Janice could be somewhere between Nicholas and Gloria). For Janice to be ancestor of Grace, we need Janice to be above Grace (i.e., Janice is ancestor of Grace). Since Grace is descendant of Gloria, if Janice is ancestor of Gloria, then Janice is also ancestor of Grace. But if Janice is descendant of Gloria, then Janice is descendant of Grace (i.e., Janice is descendant of Grace). So the relationship depends on relative positions.\n\nAlternatively, if there is a path from Gloria to Nicholas, then Gloria is ancestor of Nicholas, and thus Gloria is ancestor of Janice (since Janice is descendant of Nicholas). Then Gloria is ancestor of Janice, which means Janice is descendant of Grace? No, Grace is descendant of Gloria, so Grace is below Gloria. So if Gloria is ancestor of Nicholas, then Gloria is also ancestor of Janice. Janice is descendant of Gloria, thus Janice is descendant of Grace? Not necessarily, because Grace is descendant of Gloria but not necessarily descendant of Janice. So Janice being descendant of Gloria does not automatically make Janice descendant of Grace; Grace is a different branch. So Janice and Grace may share a common ancestor (Gloria) but not be ancestor/descendant.\n\nThus the relationship between Janice and Grace could be: they share a common ancestor (Gloria or Nicholas). Or share a common descendant (maybe some person who is descendant of both). Or none.\n\nWe need to examine the graph to see if there is any connection between Janice and Grace.\n\nGiven the size of graph, we need to find connectivity. Let's start building adjacency lists.\n\nWe'll go through each edge and add to adjacency list for each person.\n\nList all persons (some may appear multiple times). We'll maintain a dictionary of ancestors (incoming edges) and descendants (outgoing edges). Actually each node has outgoing edges (its descendants) and incoming edges (its ancestors). Let's compile.\n\nWe'll parse each edge again and store.\n\nWe'll create a table: For each person, list its descendants (outgoing edges). Also list its ancestors (incoming edges). Then we can compute transitive closure.\n\nGiven the number of relationships, we need to carefully track each. Let's do this systematically.\n\nWe'll maintain a list of edges (source -> target) where source is ancestor.\n\nList again with edges:\n\n1. Amber -> Megan\n2. Kyle -> Kathleen (since Kathleen is descendant of Kyle)\n3. Emma -> Frances\n4. Gerald -> Gary\n5. Victoria -> Madison\n6. Bobby -> Ronald\n7. Mason -> Karen\n8. Janet -> Gerald\n9.

Pamela -> John\n28. Olivia -> Victoria\n29. Joshua -> Danielle\n30. Gloria -> Grace\n31. Paul -> Emma\n32. Benjamin -> Jordan\n33. Edward -> Zachary\n34. Lawrence -> Justin\n35. Sandra -> Rachel\n36.

Shirley -> Nicholas\n\nNow we have all edges.\n\nWe need to find connectivity between Janice and Grace.\n\nGrace has incoming edge from Gloria: Gloria -> Grace. So Grace is descendant of Gloria.\n\nThus we need to find any path from Janice to Grace (descendant relationship). That would mean there is a directed path from Janice to Grace (i.e., Janice is ancestor of Grace). Or from Grace to Janice (Grace ancestor of Janice). Or they share a common ancestor (i.e., there exists a node that has paths to both Janice and Grace). Or share a common descendant (i.e., there is a node that both Janice and Grace have paths to). Or none.\n\nThus we need to find if there is any path connecting the subgraphs.\n\nGiven the graph is large, we need to compute ancestors and descendants for Janice and Grace.\n\nLet's start with Janice.\n\n Janice's outgoing edges (descendants): None (since no edge from Janice to others). However, Janice has incoming edge from Nicholas: Nicholas -> Janice. So Janice's ancestors: all ancestors of Nicholas (including Nicholas itself) and also any ancestors of Janice's ancestors.\n\nThus Janice's ancestors include Nicholas, plus ancestors of Nicholas (parents of Nicholas, etc.). So we need to compute the ancestry of Nicholas.\n\nGrace's ancestors: Gloria, plus ancestors of Gloria.\n\nThus to see if Janice and Grace share a common ancestor, we need to see if there is any node that is ancestor of both Janice and Grace (i.e., reachable from that node to both Janice and Grace). That is, we need to find intersection of ancestors of Janice and ancestors of Grace.\n\nAlternatively, they could share a common descendant if there is a node reachable from both Janice and Grace (i.e., descendant reachable from both). That would be intersection of descendants of Janice and descendants of Grace.\n\nThus we need to compute ancestors/descendants for Janice and Grace.\n\nGiven the graph size, we need to systematically compute these sets.\n\nApproach: We'll treat each node as a vertex, and compute transitive closure using manual reasoning. Since the graph is large but likely not extremely deep (maybe up to 10-12 levels). We can manually traverse.\n\nWe'll need to keep track of each person's ancestors and descendants.\n\nGiven the many relationships, we need to be systematic. Let's list all persons with their immediate children (descendants) and immediate parents (ancestors). Then compute transitive closure.\n\nGiven the graph is directed upward (ancestors -> descendants). So each node has children (descendants) and parents (ancestors). We'll compute ancestors recursively.\n\nBetter approach: For each person, compute the set of all ancestors (including themselves maybe). Then we can check for Janice and Grace.\n\nAlternatively, compute for each node the set of all descendants.\n\nGiven the number of relationships, we can start with the leaf nodes and propagate upward. However, we need to be careful about cycles (should not be any). Let's verify if any cycles appear: For example, see if any node appears as both ancestor and descendant in a chain that could cause cycles. But likely not.\n\nWe'll need to handle many nodes: Let's list all unique names:\n\nFrom edges, we have:\n\nAmber, Megan, Kyle, Kathleen, Emma, Frances, Gerald, Gary, Victoria, Madison, Bobby, Ronald, Mason, Karen, Janet, Matthew, Ruth, Richard, Cheryl, Sarah, Amanda, Alice, Harold, Logan, Robert, Samuel, Stephen, Joseph, Matthew, Brandon, Juan, Donald, Russell, Jean, Thomas, Nathan, Dennis, Timothy, Eric, Mary, Stephanie, Gabriel, Jean (again), Kimberly, Ann, Brian, Richard (again), Albert, Sarah (again), Frank, Pamela, John, Olivia, Victoria (again), Joshua, Danielle, Gloria, Grace, Paul, Benjamin, Jordan, Edward, Zachary, Lawrence, Justin, Sandra, Rachel, Frank (again), Anthony, Teresa, Alice (again), Jordan (again), Mary (again), Tyler, Jeremy, Melissa, Janet (again), Russell (again), Arthur, Ashley, Alexander, Jeremy (again), Scott, Ralph, Logan (again), Ruth (again), Noah, Denise, Kimberly (again), Henry, Evelyn, Samantha, Frances (again), Debra, Catherine, Marilyn, Samuel (again), Joseph (again), Kevin, Anthony (again), Douglas, Laura, Billy, Daniel, Kyle (again), Rebecca, Henry (again), Bobby (again), Jennifer, Denise (again), Joyce, Helen, Timothy (again), Edward (again), Patricia, Theresa, Jennifer (again), Joshua (again), Megan (again), William, Benjamin (again), Amanda, Wayne, Melissa (again), Evelyn (again), Emily, Bruce, Joyce (again), Harold (again), Jason, Christine, Kevin (again), Martha, Olivia (again), Zachary (again), Margaret, Christine (again), Brandon (again), Adam, Debra (again), Paul (again), Mason (again), Raymond, Janice, Nicholas, Ashley (again), Keith, Angela, Maria, Jason (again), Theresa (again), Billy (again), Gabriel (again), Barbara, Daniel (again), Scott (again), Julie, Ethan, Sophia, Joe, Virginia, Jacqueline, Dennis (again), Barbara (again), Bradley, Jesse, Anna, Jacqueline (again), Sandra (again), Stephen (again), Katherine, Isabella, Jacob, Donna, Albert (again), Isabella (again), Cheryl (again), Keith (again), Marilyn (again), Jesse (again), Maria (again), Anna (again), John (again), Patricia (again), Douglas (again), Adam (again), Amber (again), Sharon, Ann (again), Aaron, Abigail, Juan (again), Donald (again), Catherine (again), Wayne (again), Dylan, Angela (again), Julie (again), Bradley (again), Danielle (again), Aaron (again), William (again), Katherine (again), Teresa (again), Thomas (again), David, Donna (again), Brian, Noah (again), Justin (again), Bruce (again), Martha (again), Nathan (again), Karen (again), Dylan (again), Rebecca (again), Arthur (again), Samantha (again), Jerry, David (again), Abigail (again), Rachel (again), Ethan (again), Sophia (again), Margaret (again), Madison (again), Shirley, Gary (again), Laura (again), Joe (again), Eric (again), Tyler (again), Jacob (again), Raymond (again), Robert (again), Ralph (again), Ronald (again), Helen (again), Jerry (again), Kathleen (again), Emily (again), Pamela (again), Lawrence (again), Diana (again), Sharon (again), Diana (again), Nicholas (again), Shirley (again), etc.\n\nThus many names appear multiple times.\n\nGoal: find relationship between Janice and Grace.\n\nThus we need to compute ancestors of Janice (i.e., all nodes that can reach Janice) and ancestors of Grace (all nodes that can reach Grace). If there is intersection, they share a common ancestor. If Janice can reach Grace (i.e., Janice is ancestor of Grace), then Janice->...->Grace path exists. If Grace can reach Janice (Grace is ancestor of Janice), then path from Grace to Janice exists.\n\nIf no intersection and no path, then none.\n\nThus we need to compute ancestors for Janice and Grace.\n\nGiven the graph is large, but we can try to compute ancestors for Janice by tracing back from Janice via incoming edges.\n\nLet's start building a graph of incoming edges (ancestors). For each node, we have a list of immediate parents (ancestors) i.e., nodes that have an edge to it.\n\nWe'll create a table:\n\n- Amber: incoming? Amber is ancestor of Megan (Amber->Megan). Also Amber is descendant of Alexander (Alexander->Amber). So immediate parents: Alexander (since Alexander->Amber). Also any other? Amber is also descendant of ??? Let's see if any other edges have Amber as target. Only that. So immediate parents: Alexander.\n\n- Megan: incoming from Amber (Amber->Megan). Also incoming from Joshua (Megan->Joshua).

Let's parse all relationships:\n\nList given:\n\n* Amber is Megan's ancestor.\n* Kathleen is Kyle's descendant.\n* Emma is Frances's ancestor.\n* Gary is Gerald's descendant.\n* Victoria is Madison's ancestor.\n* Ronald is Bobby's descendant.\n* Mason is Karen's ancestor.\n* Gerald is Janet's descendant.\n* Ruth is Matthew's descendant.\n* Cheryl is Richard's descendant.\n* Sarah is Amanda's ancestor.\n* Alice is Harold's ancestor.\n* Logan is Robert's ancestor.\n* Stephen is Samuel's descendant.\n* Joseph is Matthew's ancestor.\n* Brandon is Juan's ancestor.\n* Russell is Donald's descendant.\n* Jean is Thomas's ancestor.\n* Nathan is Dennis's descendant.\n* Timothy is Eric's ancestor.\n* Stephanie is Mary's descendant.\n* Jean is Gabriel's descendant.\n* Ann is Kimberly's descendant.\n* Brian is Richard's ancestor.\n* Albert is Sarah's ancestor.\n* Frank is Stephanie's descendant.\n* Pamela is John's ancestor.\n* Olivia is Victoria's ancestor.\n* Danielle is Joshua's descendant.\n* Gloria is Grace's ancestor.\n* Emma is Paul's descendant.\n* Benjamin is Jordan's ancestor.\n* Edward is Zachary's ancestor.\n* Lawrence is Justin's ancestor.\n* Rachel is Sandra's descendant.\n* Anthony is Frank's descendant.\n* Teresa is Alice's ancestor.\n* Mary is Jordan's descendant.\n* Jeremy is Tyler's descendant.\n* Janet is Melissa's descendant.\n* Russell is Arthur's ancestor.\n* Ashley is Alexander's ancestor.\n* Jeremy is Scott's ancestor.\n* Logan is Ralph's descendant.\n* Noah is Ruth's descendant.\n* Denise is Kimberly's ancestor.\n* Evelyn is Henry's descendant.\n* Samantha is Frances's descendant.\n* Debra is Catherine's descendant.\n* Marilyn is Samuel's ancestor.\n* Joseph is Kevin's descendant.\n* Anthony is Douglas's ancestor.\n* Laura is Billy's ancestor.\n* Daniel is Kyle's ancestor.\n* Rebecca is Henry's ancestor.\n* Bobby is Jennifer's descendant.\n* Denise is Joyce's descendant.\n* Helen is Timothy's ancestor.\n* Edward is Patricia's descendant.\n* Theresa is Jennifer's ancestor.\n* Joshua is Megan's descendant.\n* William is Benjamin's descendant.\n* Amanda is Wayne's ancestor.\n* Melissa is Evelyn's descendant.\n* Emily is Bruce's descendant.\n* Joyce is Harold's descendant.\n* Jason is Christine's descendant.\n* Kevin is Martha's descendant.\n* Olivia is Zachary's descendant.\n* Margaret is Christine's ancestor.\n* Brandon is Adam's descendant.\n* Debra is Paul's ancestor.\n* Mason is Raymond's descendant.\n* Janice is Nicholas's descendant.\n* Ashley is Keith's descendant.\n* Angela is Maria's ancestor.\n* Jason is Theresa's ancestor.\n* Billy is Gabriel's ancestor.\n* Barbara is Daniel's ancestor.\n* Scott is Julie's ancestor.\n* Ethan is Sophia's ancestor.\n* Joe is Virginia's ancestor.\n* Jacqueline is Dennis's ancestor.\n* Barbara is Bradley's descendant.\n* Jesse is Virginia's descendant.\n* Anna is Jacqueline's ancestor.\n* Sandra is Stephen's descendant.\n* Katherine is Isabella's ancestor.\n* Jacob is Donna's descendant.\n* Albert is Isabella's descendant.\n* Cheryl is Keith's ancestor.\n* Marilyn is Jesse's descendant.\n* Maria is Anna's ancestor.\n* John is Patricia's ancestor.\n* Douglas is Adam's ancestor.\n* Amber is Alexander's descendant.\n* Sharon is Ann's descendant.\n* Aaron is Abigail's ancestor.\n* Juan is Donald's ancestor.\n* Catherine is Wayne's descendant.\n* Dylan is Angela's ancestor.\n* Julie is Bradley's ancestor.\n* Danielle is Aaron's ancestor.\n* William is Katherine's ancestor.\n* Teresa is Thomas's descendant.\n* David is Donna's ancestor.\n* Brian is Noah's descendant.\n* Justin is Bruce's ancestor.\n* Martha is Nathan's descendant.\n* Dylan is Karen's descendant.\n* Rebecca is Arthur's descendant.\n* Samantha is Jerry's ancestor.\n* David is Abigail's descendant.\n* Rachel is Ethan's ancestor.\n* Margaret is Sophia's descendant.\n* Madison is Shirley's ancestor.\n* Gary is Laura's ancestor.\n* Joe is Eric's descendant.\n* Tyler is Jacob's descendant.\n* Raymond is Robert's descendant.\n* Ralph is Ronald's descendant.\n* Helen is Jerry's descendant.\n* Kathleen is Gloria's ancestor.\n* Emily is Pamela's ancestor.\n* Lawrence is Diana's descendant.\n* Sharon is Diana's ancestor.\n* Nicholas is Shirley's descendant.\n\nWe need to find relationship between Janice and Grace.\n\nFirst, find Grace: Relationship given: \"Gloria is Grace's ancestor.\"\n\nThus Gloria is ancestor of Grace. So Grace is descendant of Gloria.\n\nNow Janice: \"Janice is Nicholas's descendant.\" So Janice is descendant of Nicholas.\n\nWe need to see if there is a connection between Janice and Grace via ancestors/descendants.\n\nWe need to see if there is a path linking Janice to Grace: either Janice is ancestor of Grace, or Grace is ancestor of Janice, or they share a common ancestor, or share a common descendant.\n\nWe need to parse the graph.\n\nWe'll need to construct a directed graph where edges represent \"X is ancestor of Y\" (X -> Y) or \"X is descendant of Y\" (X -> Y? Actually if X is Y's ancestor, then X -> Y. If X is Y's descendant, then Y -> X). Let's define direction: Represent \"X is ancestor of Y\" as an edge from X to Y (X -> Y). So \"X is descendant of Y\" is edge from Y to X.\n\nThus each relationship can be expressed as directed edge.\n\nGoal: Determine relationship between Janice and Grace: Are they in same chain? If Janice is ancestor of Grace (i.e., Janice -> ... -> Grace). Or Grace is ancestor of Janice (Grace -> ... -> Janice). Or they share a common ancestor (i.e., there exists some node that is ancestor of both). Or they share a common descendant (i.e., some node that is descendant of both). Or none.\n\nWe need to examine all relationships.\n\nGiven many relationships, it's possible that Janice and Grace are related indirectly via some chain.\n\nWe need to find any chain linking Janice to Grace.\n\nLet's parse all relationships and build the graph.\n\nWe'll list each person and their known ancestors/descendants.\n\nGiven the large number, we can attempt to build a full genealogical graph. However, we need to be careful about cycles? Might be none. The relationships are all ancestor/descendant, which should be acyclic if consistent. However, there may be contradictory relationships? Possibly not. But we need to verify.\n\nGiven the number of individuals, we can try to map all relationships. Let's start by listing each relationship as a directed edge.\n\nWe'll parse each bullet:\n\n1. Amber is Megan's ancestor. Edge: Amber -> Megan.\n\n2. Kathleen is Kyle's descendant. Means Kyle is ancestor of Kathleen? Wait \"Kathleen is Kyle's descendant.\" Means Kathleen is descendant of Kyle. So edge: Kyle -> Kathleen.\n\n3. Emma is Frances's ancestor. Edge: Emma -> Frances.\n\n4. Gary is Gerald's descendant. Edge: Gerald -> Gary.\n\n5. Victoria is Madison's ancestor. Edge: Victoria -> Madison.\n\n6. Ronald is Bobby's descendant.

Edge: Sharon -> Diana.\n\n127. Nicholas is Shirley's descendant. Edge: Shirley -> Nicholas.\n\nThese are all relationships.\n\nNow we need to find relationship between Janice and Grace.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Janice is Nicholas's descendant: Edge: Nicholas -> Janice.\n\n- Grace: Gloria is Grace's ancestor: Edge: Gloria -> Grace.\n\nThus Janice is descendant of Nicholas. Grace is descendant of Gloria.\n\nWe need to see if there is any path linking Nicholas to Gloria (or Gloria to Nicholas) or any common ancestor/descendant.\n\nThus we need to examine the genealogical tree(s) to see if Nicholas and Gloria are connected.\n\nLet's list the graph edges for each person.\n\nWe'll need to consider all relationships. Then we can find the ancestors/descendants for Nicholas and Gloria. Then check if they intersect.\n\nGiven the large number of relationships, we need to systematically compute the ancestry and descendant sets.\n\nApproach: Use a systematic method: Build adjacency lists for each person (both ancestors and descendants). Then compute transitive closure.\n\nBut manually? Could be huge. However, we can try to find connections by focusing on relevant persons.\n\nWe need to find any path linking Nicholas to Gloria, or Janice to Grace.\n\nGrace is descendant of Gloria. So any ancestor of Gloria is also ancestor of Grace (if we go upward). Also any descendant of Grace is also descendant of Gloria.\n\nJanice is descendant of Nicholas. So any ancestor of Janice is also ancestor of Nicholas (if we go upward). Also any descendant of Janice is descendant of Nicholas.\n\nThus to see if Janice is ancestor/descendant of Grace, we need to see if there is a path from Janice to Grace (Janice -> ... -> Grace) or Grace -> ... -> Janice.\n\nThus we need to see if there is a chain connecting Nicholas and Gloria.\n\nThus find if there is any path from Nicholas to Gloria (or Gloria to Nicholas). If there is a path, then Janice (descendant of Nicholas) and Grace (descendant of Gloria) might be related.\n\nBut careful: If there is a path from Nicholas to Gloria, then Janice (descendant of Nicholas) might be ancestor of Grace? Actually if Nicholas is ancestor of Gloria (Nicholas -> ... -> Gloria), then any descendant of Nicholas (including Janice) is also ancestor of Gloria? Wait, if Nicholas is ancestor of Gloria, then Nicholas is above Gloria. So Janice is descendant of Nicholas, thus Janice is also descendant of Nicholas but could be above or below Gloria? Let's think.\n\nIf we have a directed graph where edges go ancestor -> descendant. So if we have a path from X to Y (X->...->Y), then X is ancestor of Y (higher) and Y is descendant of X (lower). So if we have a path from Nicholas to Gloria (Nicholas -> ... -> Gloria), then Nicholas is ancestor of Gloria, and Gloria is descendant of Nicholas.\n\nThus Janice is descendant of Nicholas, but Janice could be anywhere in the subtree of Nicholas. Could Janice be an ancestor of Gloria? No, because Janice is descendant of Nicholas, which is ancestor of Gloria. So Janice is lower than Nicholas. Since Gloria is descendant of Nicholas, Gloria is also lower than Nicholas. So Janice and Gloria are both in the subtree of Nicholas, but we need to see if Janice is ancestor of Gloria (i.e., Janice is above Gloria in the tree) or descendant of Gloria (i.e., Janice is below Gloria). If Janice is descendant of Nicholas but not descendant of Gloria, then Janice is not ancestor of Grace. However, there might be a path from Janice to Gloria (if Janice is ancestor of Gloria). That would require Janice to be above Gloria (i.e., Janice is an ancestor of Gloria). Since Janice is descendant of Nicholas, which is ancestor of Gloria, it's possible that Janice is also ancestor of Gloria if Janice is on the path between Nicholas and Gloria. But if Janice is lower than Nicholas and also lower than Gloria, then Janice cannot be ancestor of Gloria. Actually, if Nicholas is ancestor of Gloria, then the path from Nicholas to Gloria goes downwards. Janice is descendant of Nicholas but could be on that path (i.e., Janice could be somewhere between Nicholas and Gloria). For Janice to be ancestor of Grace, we need Janice to be above Grace (i.e., Janice is ancestor of Grace). Since Grace is descendant of Gloria, if Janice is ancestor of Gloria, then Janice is also ancestor of Grace. But if Janice is descendant of Gloria, then Janice is descendant of Grace (i.e., Janice is descendant of Grace). So the relationship depends on relative positions.\n\nAlternatively, if there is a path from Gloria to Nicholas, then Gloria is ancestor of Nicholas, and thus Gloria is ancestor of Janice (since Janice is descendant of Nicholas). Then Gloria is ancestor of Janice, which means Janice is descendant of Grace? No, Grace is descendant of Gloria, so Grace is below Gloria. So if Gloria is ancestor of Nicholas, then Gloria is also ancestor of Janice. Janice is descendant of Gloria, thus Janice is descendant of Grace? Not necessarily, because Grace is descendant of Gloria but not necessarily descendant of Janice. So Janice being descendant of Gloria does not automatically make Janice descendant of Grace; Grace is a different branch. So Janice and Grace may share a common ancestor (Gloria) but not be ancestor/descendant.\n\nThus the relationship between Janice and Grace could be: they share a common ancestor (Gloria or Nicholas). Or share a common descendant (maybe some person who is descendant of both). Or none.\n\nWe need to examine the graph to see if there is any connection between Janice and Grace.\n\nGiven the size of graph, we need to find connectivity. Let's start building adjacency lists.\n\nWe'll go through each edge and add to adjacency list for each person.\n\nList all persons (some may appear multiple times). We'll maintain a dictionary of ancestors (incoming edges) and descendants (outgoing edges). Actually each node has outgoing edges (its descendants) and incoming edges (its ancestors). Let's compile.\n\nWe'll parse each edge again and store.\n\nWe'll create a table: For each person, list its descendants (outgoing edges). Also list its ancestors (incoming edges). Then we can compute transitive closure.\n\nGiven the number of relationships, we need to carefully track each. Let's do this systematically.\n\nWe'll maintain a list of edges (source -> target) where source is ancestor.\n\nList again with edges:\n\n1. Amber -> Megan\n2. Kyle -> Kathleen (since Kathleen is descendant of Kyle)\n3. Emma -> Frances\n4. Gerald -> Gary\n5. Victoria -> Madison\n6. Bobby -> Ronald\n7. Mason -> Karen\n8. Janet -> Gerald\n9. Matthew -> Ruth\n10. Richard -> Cheryl\n11. Sarah -> Amanda\n12. Alice -> Harold\n13. Logan -> Robert\n14. Samuel -> Stephen\n15. Joseph -> Matthew\n16. Brandon -> Juan\n17. Donald -> Russell\n18. Jean -> Thomas\n19. Dennis -> Nathan\n20. Timothy -> Eric\n21. Mary -> Stephanie\n22. Gabriel -> Jean\n23. Kimberly -> Ann\n24. Brian -> Richard\n25. Albert -> Sarah\n26. Stephanie -> Frank\n27. Pamela -> John\n28. Olivia -> Victoria\n29. Joshua -> Danielle\n30. Gloria -> Grace\n31. Paul -> Emma\n32. Benjamin -> Jordan\n33. Edward -> Zachary\n34. Lawrence -> Justin\n35. Sandra -> Rachel\n36.

Ruth -> Noah\n46. Denise -> Kimberly\n47. Henry -> Evelyn\n48. Frances -> Samantha\n49. Catherine -> Debra\n50. Marilyn -> Samuel\n51. Kevin -> Joseph\n52. Anthony -> Douglas\n53. Laura -> Billy\n54. Daniel -> Kyle\n55. Rebecca -> Henry\n56. Jennifer -> Bobby\n57. Joyce -> Denise\n58. Helen -> Timothy\n59. Patricia -> Edward\n60. Theresa -> Jennifer\n61. Megan -> Joshua\n62. Benjamin -> William\n63. Amanda -> Wayne\n64. Evelyn -> Melissa\n65. Bruce -> Emily\n66. Harold -> Joyce\n67. Christine -> Jason\n68. Martha -> Kevin\n69. Zachary -> Olivia\n70. Margaret -> Christine\n71. Adam -> Brandon\n72. Debra -> Paul\n73. Raymond -> Mason\n74. Nicholas -> Janice\n75. Keith -> Ashley\n76. Angela -> Maria\n77. Jason -> Theresa\n78. Billy -> Gabriel\n79. Barbara -> Daniel\n80. Scott -> Julie\n81. Ethan -> Sophia\n82. Joe -> Virginia\n83. Jacqueline -> Dennis\n84. Bradley -> Barbara\n85. Virginia -> Jesse\n86. Anna -> Jacqueline\n87. Stephen -> Sandra\n88. Katherine -> Isabella\n89. Donna -> Jacob\n90. Isabella -> Albert\n91. Cheryl -> Keith\n92. Jesse -> Marilyn\n93. Maria -> Anna\n94. John -> Patricia\n95. Douglas -> Adam\n96. Alexander -> Amber\n97. Ann -> Sharon\n98. Aaron -> Abigail\n99. Juan -> Donald\n100. Wayne -> Catherine\n101. Dylan -> Angela\n102. Julie -> Bradley\n103. Danielle -> Aaron\n104. William -> Katherine\n105. Thomas -> Teresa\n106. David -> Donna\n107. Noah -> Brian\n108. Justin -> Bruce\n109. Nathan -> Martha\n110. Karen -> Dylan\n111. Arthur -> Rebecca\n112. Samantha -> Jerry\n113. Abigail -> David\n114. Rachel -> Ethan\n115. Sophia -> Margaret\n116. Madison -> Shirley\n117. Gary -> Laura\n118. Eric -> Joe\n119. Jacob -> Tyler\n120. Robert -> Raymond\n121. Ronald -> Ralph\n122. Jerry -> Helen\n123. Kathleen -> Gloria\n124. Emily -> Pamela\n125. Diana -> Lawrence\n126. Sharon -> Diana\n127. Shirley -> Nicholas\n\nNow we have all edges.\n\nWe need to find connectivity between Janice and Grace.\n\nGrace has incoming edge from Gloria: Gloria -> Grace. So Grace is descendant of Gloria.\n\nThus we need to find any path from Janice to Grace (descendant relationship). That would mean there is a directed path from Janice to Grace (i.e., Janice is ancestor of Grace). Or from Grace to Janice (Grace ancestor of Janice). Or they share a common ancestor (i.e., there exists a node that has paths to both Janice and Grace). Or share a common descendant (i.e., there is a node that both Janice and Grace have paths to). Or none.\n\nThus we need to find if there is any path connecting the subgraphs.\n\nGiven the graph is large, we need to compute ancestors and descendants for Janice and Grace.\n\nLet's start with Janice.\n\n Janice's outgoing edges (descendants): None (since no edge from Janice to others). However, Janice has incoming edge from Nicholas: Nicholas -> Janice. So Janice's ancestors: all ancestors of Nicholas (including Nicholas itself) and also any ancestors of Janice's ancestors.\n\nThus Janice's ancestors include Nicholas, plus ancestors of Nicholas (parents of Nicholas, etc.). So we need to compute the ancestry of Nicholas.\n\nGrace's ancestors: Gloria, plus ancestors of Gloria.\n\nThus to see if Janice and Grace share a common ancestor, we need to see if there is any node that is ancestor of both Janice and Grace (i.e., reachable from that node to both Janice and Grace). That is, we need to find intersection of ancestors of Janice and ancestors of Grace.\n\nAlternatively, they could share a common descendant if there is a node reachable from both Janice and Grace (i.e., descendant reachable from both). That would be intersection of descendants of Janice and descendants of Grace.\n\nThus we need to compute ancestors/descendants for Janice and Grace.\n\nGiven the graph size, we need to systematically compute these sets.\n\nApproach: We'll treat each node as a vertex, and compute transitive closure using manual reasoning. Since the graph is large but likely not extremely deep (maybe up to 10-12 levels). We can manually traverse.\n\nWe'll need to keep track of each person's ancestors and descendants.\n\nGiven the many relationships, we need to be systematic. Let's list all persons with their immediate children (descendants) and immediate parents (ancestors). Then compute transitive closure.\n\nGiven the graph is directed upward (ancestors -> descendants). So each node has children (descendants) and parents (ancestors). We'll compute ancestors recursively.\n\nBetter approach: For each person, compute the set of all ancestors (including themselves maybe). Then we can check for Janice and Grace.\n\nAlternatively, compute for each node the set of all descendants.\n\nGiven the number of relationships, we can start with the leaf nodes and propagate upward. However, we need to be careful about cycles (should not be any). Let's verify if any cycles appear: For example, see if any node appears as both ancestor and descendant in a chain that could cause cycles. But likely not.\n\nWe'll need to handle many nodes: Let's list all unique names:\n\nFrom edges, we have:\n\nAmber, Megan, Kyle, Kathleen, Emma, Frances, Gerald, Gary, Victoria, Madison, Bobby, Ronald, Mason, Karen, Janet, Matthew, Ruth, Richard, Cheryl, Sarah, Amanda, Alice, Harold, Logan, Robert, Samuel, Stephen, Joseph, Matthew, Brandon, Juan, Donald, Russell, Jean, Thomas, Nathan, Dennis, Timothy, Eric, Mary, Stephanie, Gabriel, Jean (again), Kimberly, Ann, Brian, Richard (again), Albert, Sarah (again), Frank, Pamela, John, Olivia, Victoria (again), Joshua, Danielle, Gloria, Grace, Paul, Benjamin, Jordan, Edward, Zachary, Lawrence, Justin, Sandra, Rachel, Frank (again), Anthony, Teresa, Alice (again), Jordan (again), Mary (again), Tyler, Jeremy, Melissa, Janet (again), Russell (again), Arthur, Ashley, Alexander, Jeremy (again), Scott, Ralph, Logan (again), Ruth (again), Noah, Denise, Kimberly (again), Henry, Evelyn, Samantha, Frances (again), Debra, Catherine, Marilyn, Samuel (again), Joseph (again), Kevin, Anthony (again), Douglas, Laura, Billy, Daniel, Kyle (again), Rebecca, Henry (again), Bobby (again), Jennifer, Denise (again), Joyce, Helen, Timothy (again), Edward (again), Patricia, Theresa, Jennifer (again), Joshua (again), Megan (again), William, Benjamin (again), Amanda, Wayne, Melissa (again), Evelyn (again), Emily, Bruce, Joyce (again), Harold (again), Jason, Christine, Kevin (again), Martha, Olivia (again), Zachary (again), Margaret, Christine (again), Brandon (again), Adam, Debra (again), Paul (again), Mason (again), Raymond, Janice, Nicholas, Ashley (again), Keith, Angela, Maria, Jason (again), Theresa (again), Billy (again), Gabriel (again), Barbara, Daniel (again), Scott (again), Julie, Ethan, Sophia, Joe, Virginia, Jacqueline, Dennis (again), Barbara (again), Bradley, Jesse, Anna, Jacqueline (again), Sandra (again), Stephen (again), Katherine, Isabella, Jacob, Donna, Albert (again), Isabella (again), Cheryl (again), Keith (again), Marilyn (again), Jesse (again), Maria (again), Anna (again), John (again), Patricia (again), Douglas (again), Adam (again), Amber (again), Sharon, Ann (again), Aaron, Abigail, Juan (again), Donald (again), Catherine (again), Wayne (again), Dylan, Angela (again), Julie (again), Bradley (again), Danielle (again), Aaron (again), William (again), Katherine (again), Teresa (again), Thomas (again), David, Donna (again), Brian, Noah (again), Justin (again), Bruce (again), Martha (again), Nathan (again), Karen (again), Dylan (again), Rebecca (again), Arthur (again), Samantha (again), Jerry, David (again), Abigail (again), Rachel (again), Ethan (again), Sophia (again), Margaret (again), Madison (again), Shirley, Gary (again), Laura (again), Joe (again), Eric (again), Tyler (again), Jacob (again), Raymond (again), Robert (again), Ralph (again), Ronald (again), Helen (again), Jerry (again), Kathleen (again), Emily (again), Pamela (again), Lawrence (again), Diana (again), Sharon (again), Diana (again), Nicholas (again), Shirley (again), etc.\n\nThus many names appear multiple times.\n\nGoal: find relationship between Janice and Grace.\n\nThus we need to compute ancestors of Janice (i.e., all nodes that can reach Janice) and ancestors of Grace (all nodes that can reach Grace). If there is intersection, they share a common ancestor. If Janice can reach Grace (i.e., Janice is ancestor of Grace), then Janice->...->Grace path exists. If Grace can reach Janice (Grace is ancestor of Janice), then path from Grace to Janice exists.\n\nIf no intersection and no path, then none.\n\nThus we need to compute ancestors for Janice and Grace.\n\nGiven the graph is large, but we can try to compute ancestors for Janice by tracing back from Janice via incoming edges.\n\nLet's start building a graph of incoming edges (ancestors). For each node, we have a list of immediate parents (ancestors) i.e., nodes that have an edge to it.\n\nWe'll create a table:\n\n- Amber: incoming? Amber is ancestor of Megan (Amber->Megan). Also Amber is descendant of Alexander (Alexander->Amber). So immediate parents: Alexander (since Alexander->Amber). Also any other? Amber is also descendant of ??? Let's see if any other edges have Amber as target. Only that. So immediate parents: Alexander.\n\n- Megan: incoming from Amber (Amber->Megan). Also incoming from Joshua (Megan->Joshua).
