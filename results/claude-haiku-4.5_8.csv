Let me convert each statement to ancestor → descendant notation:

1. Sandra is Beverly's descendant: **Beverly → Sandra**
2. Sandra is Christine's ancestor: **Sandra → Christine**
3. Beverly is Samuel's descendant: **Samuel → Beverly**
4. Terry is Samuel's ancestor: **Terry → Samuel**
5. Alice is Christine's ancestor: **Alice → Christine**
6. Alice is Karen's descendant: **Karen → Alice**
7. Terry is Andrea's descendant: **Andrea → Terry**

Now I'll trace the complete lineage chains:

**Chain 1:** Andrea → Terry → Samuel → Beverly → Sandra → Christine

**Chain 2:** Karen → Alice → Christine

Both chains lead to Christine, meaning both Andrea and Karen have Christine as a descendant. They both have ancestral connections to Christine through different paths.

Let me analyze the relationship:
- Andrea's lineage: Andrea is the ancestor of everyone in Chain 1
- Karen's lineage: Karen is the ancestor of everyone in Chain 2
- Common terminal point: Christine

Since both chains converge at Christine:
- Christine is a descendant of Andrea (through the first chain)
- Christine is a descendant of Karen (through the second chain)
- Sandra is also part of chains leading to Christine
- Therefore, both Andrea and Karen are ancestors leading to the same descendant (Christine)

Additionally:
- Sandra is a descendant of Andrea (Andrea → ... → Sandra)
- Sandra is an ancestor of Christine
- Karen is an ancestor of Alice
- Alice is an ancestor of Christine

Both Andrea and Karen share Christine as a common descendant, and potentially Sandra as well (depending on how the chains connect through Alice and Sandra).

Let me first interpret the relationships correctly:
- ""X is Y's descendant"" means Y is X's ancestor (Y → X)
- ""X is Y's ancestor"" means Y is X's descendant (X → Y)

**Building the first chain (around Jason/Randy/Marie/Debra/Elizabeth):**

From the facts:
- ""Teresa is Jason's ancestor"" → Teresa → Jason
- ""Randy is Jason's descendant"" → Jason → Randy  
- ""Marie is Randy's descendant"" → Randy → Marie
- ""Marie is Debra's ancestor"" → Marie → Debra
- ""Elizabeth is Debra's descendant"" → Debra → Elizabeth

Chain so far: **Teresa → Jason → Randy → Marie → Debra → Elizabeth**

**Building the second chain (around Ann/Walter):**

From the facts:
- ""Ann is Walter's ancestor"" → Ann → Walter
- ""Teresa is Walter's descendant"" → Walter → Teresa

This gives us: **Ann → Walter → Teresa**

**Connecting the chains:**

Since Teresa appears in both chains, I can connect them:
**Ann → Walter → Teresa → Jason → Randy → Marie → Debra → Elizabeth**

This establishes a complete lineage chain from Ann all the way to Elizabeth.

Therefore, **Ann is Elizabeth's ancestor**.

5. Randy is Roger's descendant → Roger → Randy
6. Roger is Willie's ancestor → Roger → Willie
7. Julie is Jean's ancestor → Julie → Jean

**Building the chain:**

Starting from fact 6 and 3: Roger → Willie → Carl
Adding fact 2: Roger → Willie → Carl → Julie
Adding fact 7: Roger → Willie → Carl → Julie → Jean
Adding fact 4: Roger → Willie → Carl → Julie → Jean → Gerald
Adding fact 1: Roger → Willie → Carl → Julie → Jean → Gerald → Helen

Adding fact 5: Roger → Randy

**Result:**

The complete lineage can be represented as:
```
                Roger
               /     \
            Randy    Willie → Carl → Julie → Jean → Gerald → Helen
```

Both Randy and Helen are descendants of Roger, but they are not in a direct ancestor-descendant relationship with each other.

Therefore, **Randy and Helen share a common ancestor** (Roger).

**Analysis:**

Both chains converge at the same person: Ralph

- Sophia is an ancestor of Ralph (through the path: Jeremy → Bryan → Madison → Catherine → Ralph)
- Christine is an ancestor of Ralph (through the path: Amanda → Ralph)

This means Ralph is a **common descendant** of both Sophia and Christine through different lineage paths.

- Joan is Sharon's ancestor → Brittany → Sandra → Joan → Sharon

**Summary:**
- **Path 1:** Brittany → Sandra → Joan → Sharon → Diana → Christina → Mason
- **Path 2:** Angela → Mason

Now, analyzing the relationship between Angela and Brittany:

Since the problem presents 8 distinct names (Mason, Angela, Sandra, Joan, Sharon, Diana, Brittany, Christina), these should be treated as different people.

This means:
- Angela is not in the Brittany chain (they are separate people)
- Both Angela and Brittany are ancestors of Mason
- Mason is a descendant of both Angela and Brittany

Therefore, **Angela and Brittany share a common descendant** - Mason.

They are not directly related to each other (neither is an ancestor of the other), but they do have descendants in common.
