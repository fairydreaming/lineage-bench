This suggests that **Emma is an ancestor of Scott**?\n\nBecause we started from Scott and went upward through ancestors, and eventually reached Emma.\n\nBut is that valid? Let's double-check the direction.\n\nWe must be careful: when we say \"X is Y's ancestor\", that means X → Y (X above Y). So to get ancestors of Scott, we go **up** the chain: who is above Scott?\n\nGiven:\n- Frank is Scott's ancestor → Frank → Scott\n- Frank is Christopher's descendant → Christopher → Frank → Scott\n- Christine is Christopher's ancestor → Christine → Christopher → Frank → Scott\n\nSo ancestors of Scott: Frank, Christopher, Christine, etc.\n\nNow, from Christine:\n- Christine is Isabella's descendant → Isabella → Christine → Christopher → Frank → Scott\n\nSo Isabella is ancestor of Scott.\n\n- Beverly is Isabella's ancestor → Beverly → Isabella → Christine → ... → Scott\n\nSo Beverly is ancestor.\n\n- Beverly is Jacqueline's descendant → Jacqueline → Beverly → Isabella → ... → Scott\n\nSo Jacqueline is ancestor.\n\n- Jacqueline is Jessica's descendant → Jessica → Jacqueline → ... → Scott\n\nSo Jessica is ancestor.\n\n- Douglas is Jessica's ancestor → Douglas → Jessica → ... → Scott\n\nSo Douglas is ancestor.\n\n- Joe is Douglas's ancestor → Joe → Douglas → ... → Scott\n\nSo Joe is ancestor.\n\n- Joe is Walter's descendant → Walter → Joe → ... → Scott\n\nSo Walter is ancestor.\n\n- Susan is Walter's ancestor → Susan → Walter → ... → Scott\n\nSo Susan is ancestor.\n\n- Grace is Susan's ancestor → Grace → Susan → ... → Scott\n\nSo Grace is ancestor.\n\n- Gabriel is Grace's ancestor → Gabriel → Grace → ... → Scott\n\nSo Gabriel is ancestor.\n\n- Gabriel is Sean's descendant → Sean → Gabriel → ... → Scott\n\nWait! Hold on. This is critical.\n\nStatement: \"Gabriel is Sean's descendant.\" → So Sean → Gabriel\n\nBut we just used: Gabriel → Grace (from \"Gabriel is Grace's ancestor\") → which is correct per statement 28: \"Gabriel is Grace's ancestor\" → Gabriel → Grace\n\nSo chain is: Sean → Gabriel → Grace → Susan → Walter → Joe → Douglas → Jessica → Jacqueline → Beverly → Isabella → Christine → Christopher → Frank → Scott\n\nSo **Sean is an ancestor of Scott**.\n\nContinue:\n\n- Sean is Joshua's descendant → Joshua → Sean → ... → Scott\n\nSo Joshua is ancestor of Scott.\n\n- Janet is Joshua's ancestor → Janet → Joshua → ... → Scott\n\nSo Janet is ancestor.\n\n- Janet is Bobby's descendant → Bobby → Janet → ... → Scott\n\nSo Bobby is ancestor.\n\n- Jacob is Bobby's ancestor → Jacob → Bobby → ... → Scott\n\nSo Jacob is ancestor.\n\n- Laura is Jacob's ancestor → Laura → Jacob → ... → Scott\n\nSo Laura is ancestor.\n\n- Laura is Sara's descendant → Sara → Laura → ... → Scott\n\nSo Sara is ancestor.\n\n- Anthony is Sara's ancestor → Anthony → Sara → ... → Scott\n\nSo Anthony is ancestor.\n\n- Lori is Anthony's ancestor → Lori → Anthony → ... → Scott\n\nSo Lori is ancestor.\n\n- Natalie is Lori's ancestor → Natalie → Lori → ... → Scott\n\nSo Natalie is ancestor.\n\n- Natalie is Angela's descendant → Angela → Natalie → ... → Scott\n\nSo Angela is ancestor.\n\n- Daniel is Angela's ancestor → Daniel → Angela → ... → Scott\n\nSo Daniel is ancestor.\n\n- Jennifer is Daniel's ancestor → Jennifer → Daniel → ... → Scott\n\nSo Jennifer is ancestor.\n\n- Andrew is Jennifer's ancestor → Andrew → Jennifer → ... → Scott\n\nSo Andrew is ancestor.\n\n- Michelle is Andrew's ancestor → Michelle → Andrew → ... → Scott\n\nSo Michelle is ancestor.\n\n- Harold is Michelle's ancestor → Harold → Michelle → ... → Scott\n\nSo Harold is ancestor.\n\n- Harold is Billy's descendant → Billy → Harold → ... → Scott\n\nSo Billy is ancestor.\n\n- Billy is Logan's descendant → Logan → Billy → ... → Scott\n\nSo Logan is ancestor.\n\n- Logan is Brian's descendant → Brian → Logan → ... → Scott\n\nSo Brian is ancestor.\n\n- Kayla is Brian's ancestor → Kayla → Brian → ... → Scott\n\nSo Kayla is ancestor.\n\n- Kayla is Kimberly's descendant → Kimberly → Kayla → ... → Scott\n\nSo Kimberly is ancestor.\n\n- Kimberly is John's descendant → John → Kimberly → ... → Scott\n\nSo John is ancestor.\n\n- John is Ralph's descendant → Ralph → John → ... → Scott\n\nSo Ralph is ancestor.\n\n- Aaron is Ralph's ancestor → Aaron → Ralph → ... → Scott\n\nSo Aaron is ancestor.\n\n- Arthur is Aaron's ancestor → Arthur → Aaron → ... → Scott\n\nSo Arthur is ancestor.\n\n- Rachel is Arthur's ancestor → Rachel → Arthur → ... → Scott\n\nSo Rachel is ancestor.\n\n- Rachel is Jesse's descendant → Jesse → Rachel → ... → Scott\n\nSo Jesse is ancestor.\n\n- Jesse is Jeremy's descendant → Jeremy → Jesse → ... → Scott\n\nSo Jeremy is ancestor.\n\n- Donna is Jeremy's ancestor → Donna → Jeremy → ... → Scott\n\nSo Donna is ancestor.\n\n- Andrea is Donna's ancestor → Andrea → Donna → ... → Scott\n\nSo Andrea is ancestor.\n\n- Olivia is Andrea's ancestor → Olivia → Andrea → ... → Scott\n\nSo Olivia is ancestor.\n\n- Olivia is Rebecca's descendant → Rebecca → Olivia → ... → Scott\n\nSo Rebecca is ancestor.\n\n- Tyler is Rebecca's ancestor → Tyler → Rebecca → ... → Scott\n\nSo Tyler is ancestor.\n\n- Tyler is Samantha's descendant → Samantha → Tyler → ... → Scott\n\nSo Samantha is ancestor.\n\n- Kelly is Samantha's ancestor → Kelly → Samantha → ... → Scott\n\nSo Kelly is ancestor.\n\n- Marie is Kelly's ancestor → Marie → Kelly → ... → Scott\n\nSo Marie is ancestor.\n\n- Marie is Robert's descendant → Robert → Marie → ... → Scott\n\nSo Robert is ancestor.\n\n- Elizabeth is Robert's ancestor → Elizabeth → Robert → ... → Scott\n\nSo Elizabeth is ancestor.\n\n- Richard is Elizabeth's ancestor → Richard → Elizabeth → ... → Scott\n\nSo Richard is ancestor.\n\n- Kyle is Richard's ancestor → Kyle → Richard → ... → Scott\n\nSo Kyle is ancestor.\n\n- Nicole is Kyle's ancestor → Nicole → Kyle → ... → Scott\n\nSo Nicole is ancestor.\n\n- Elijah is Nicole's ancestor → Elijah → Nicole → ... → Scott\n\nSo Elijah is ancestor.\n\n- Hannah is Elijah's ancestor → Hannah → Elijah → ... → Scott\n\nSo Hannah is ancestor.\n\n- Hannah is Juan's descendant → Juan → Hannah → ... → Scott\n\nSo Juan is ancestor.\n\n- Juan is James's descendant → James → Juan → ... → Scott\n\nSo James is ancestor.\n\n- Russell is James's ancestor → Russell → James → ... → Scott\n\nSo Russell is ancestor.\n\n- Bryan is Russell's ancestor → Bryan → Russell → ... → Scott\n\nSo Bryan is ancestor.\n\n- Jason is Bryan's ancestor → Jason → Bryan → ... → Scott\n\nSo Jason is ancestor.\n\n- Jason is Jose's descendant → Jose → Jason → ... → Scott\n\nSo Jose is ancestor.\n\n- Emma is Jose's ancestor → Emma → Jose → ... → Scott\n\nSo **Emma is an ancestor of Scott**.\n\nTherefore, **Scott is Emma's descendant**.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n**3.
