We have:\n\n- Justin → Jack (so Jack is descendant of Justin) → So **Justin is ancestor of Jack**, so **Jack is below Justin**, so the chain should be: ... → Justin → Jack\n\nBut we have **Mark → Justin**, so: Mark → Justin → Jack\n\nAnd **Jacqueline → Mark**, so: Jacqueline → Mark → Justin → Jack\n\nAnd **Wayne → Jacqueline**, so: Wayne → Jacqueline → Mark → Justin → Jack\n\nAnd **Christopher → Wayne**, so: Christopher → Wayne → ...\n\nAnd **Abigail → Christopher**, so: Abigail → Christopher → ...\n\nAnd **Thomas → Abigail**?

No, because Matthew is an ancestor of Jack, so the direction is opposite.\n\nFrom Jack, we cannot go to Matthew in descendant direction.\n\nSo the Gerald chain **ends** at Jack (as a leaf in this data), unless there are further descendants of Jack not listed.\n\nNow, where is **Ruth** in all this?\n\nRuth is at the **top** of a chain that goes down to Rebecca, Noah, ..., and eventually also reaches **Jack** (through Matthew).\n\nBut **Matthew** is not in Gerald's descendant chain (since to get to Matthew, we'd need to go upward from Jack, which is not allowed in descendant direction).\n\nTherefore, **Ruth and Gerald are on separate branches** that **converge at Jack** only if we allow going up and down, but in lineage terms, that would mean they are **ancestors of a common descendant (Jack)**.\n\nLet’s verify: Is **Jack** a descendant of **Ruth**?\n\nRuth → Rebecca → Noah → Henry → Diane → Martha → Amanda → Kimberly → Elizabeth → Sandra → Kenneth → Joyce → Marilyn → Robert → Jeremy → Katherine → Carl → Kelly → Joan → Helen → Adam → Matthew → Jack\n\nYes, if all those links are valid.\n\nAnd is **Jack** a descendant of **Gerald**?\n\nGerald → ... → Justin → Jack\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, **Ruth and Gerald are both ancestors of Jack**.\n\nThus, they **share a common descendant**: Jack.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n**1.
