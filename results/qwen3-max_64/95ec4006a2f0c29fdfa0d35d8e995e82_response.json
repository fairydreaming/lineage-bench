So unless implied, we assume none listed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: List relevant chains involving **Shirley**\n\nGiven:\n- **James is Shirley's ancestor** → James → Shirley\n- **James is Carolyn's descendant** → Carolyn → James → Shirley\n- **Carolyn is Daniel's descendant** → Daniel → Carolyn → James → Shirley\n- **Daniel is Keith's ancestor** → Daniel → Keith (but that’s a different branch; not helpful for Shirley’s ancestors beyond Daniel)\n  \nSo Shirley’s **ancestors**:\n- James\n- Carolyn\n- Daniel\n\nShirley’s **descendants**: None given.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compare ancestors of Randy and Shirley\n\nRandy’s ancestors: Debra, Elizabeth, Kelly, Natalie, Brandon  \nShirley’s ancestors: James, Carolyn, Daniel\n\nNo overlap so far.\n\nNow check if any of Randy’s **descendants** appear in Shirley’s ancestry or vice versa.\n\nBut we don’t have any descendants of Randy listed.\n\nDo we have any common **descendants**? That would require someone who is a descendant of both Randy and Shirley. No such person is listed.\n\nBut wait — maybe we need to go further up the tree. Perhaps some of the ancestors we listed have common ancestors not immediately obvious.\n\nLet’s check if any of the ancestors of Randy and Shirley eventually connect.\n\n#### Explore Randy’s ancestors further:\n\nWe had:\n- Brandon → Natalie → Kelly → Elizabeth → Debra → Randy\n\nIs there any info about **Brandon’s ancestors**?\n\nYes:\n- **Noah is Brandon's ancestor** → Noah → Brandon → ... → Randy\n- Also: **Noah is Samuel's descendant** → Samuel → Noah → Brandon → ... → Randy\n- **Frank is Samuel's ancestor** → Frank → Samuel → Noah → Brandon → ... → Randy\n- **Barbara is Frank's ancestor** → Barbara → Frank → Samuel → Noah → Brandon → ... → Randy\n- **Barbara is Richard's descendant** → Richard → Barbara → Frank → ...\n- **Doris is Richard's ancestor** → Doris → Richard → Barbara → ...\n\nSo Randy’s ancestors also include:\n- Noah\n- Samuel\n- Frank\n- Barbara\n- Richard\n- Doris\n- (and possibly Juan, since Doris is Juan’s descendant → Juan → Doris → ...? Wait, careful.)\n\nWait: “Doris is Juan's descendant” → Juan → Doris → Richard → Barbara → Frank → Samuel → Noah → Brandon → Natalie → Kelly → Elizabeth → Debra → Randy\n\nSo **Juan** is an ancestor of Doris, so also of Randy.\n\nAlso: “Juan is Charlotte's descendant” → Charlotte → Juan → Doris → ... → Randy  \nAnd: “Gloria is Charlotte's ancestor” → Gloria → Charlotte → Juan → ... → Randy  \nAlso: “Gloria is Walter's descendant” → Walter → Gloria → Charlotte → ... → Randy  \nAnd: “Austin is Walter's ancestor” → Austin → Walter → Gloria → ... → Randy  \n“Benjamin is Austin's ancestor” → Benjamin → Austin → ... → Randy  \n“Jean is Benjamin's ancestor” → Jean → Benjamin → ... → Randy  \n“Jean is Edward's descendant” → Edward → Jean → ... → Randy  \n“Bradley is Edward's ancestor” → Bradley → Edward → Jean → ... → Randy  \n“Christopher is Bradley's ancestor” → Christopher → Bradley → ... → Randy  \n“Carol is Christopher's ancestor” → Carol → Christopher → ... → Randy  \n“Zachary is Carol's ancestor” → Zachary → Carol → ... → Randy  \n“Zachary is Aaron's descendant” → Aaron → Zachary → ... → Randy  \n“Emily is Aaron's ancestor” → Emily → Aaron → ... → Randy  \n“Wayne is Emily's ancestor” → Wayne → Emily → ... → Randy  \n“Bryan is Wayne's ancestor” → Bryan → Wayne → ... → Randy  \n“Bryan is Peter's descendant” → Peter → Bryan → ... → Randy  \n“Peter is Douglas's descendant” → Douglas → Peter → Bryan → ... → Randy  \n“Beverly is Douglas's ancestor” → Beverly → Douglas → ... → Randy  \n“Martha is Beverly's ancestor” → Martha → Beverly → ... → Randy  \n“Jerry is Martha's ancestor” → Jerry → Martha → ... → Randy  \n“Jerry is Jennifer's descendant” → Jennifer → Jerry → ... → Randy  \n“Jennifer is Alan's descendant” → Alan → Jennifer → ... → Randy  \n“Alan is Carl's descendant” → Carl → Alan → ... → Randy  \n“Carl is Andrew's descendant” → Andrew → Carl → ... → Randy  \n“Hannah is Andrew's ancestor” → Hannah → Andrew → ... → Randy  \n“Hannah is Janice's descendant” → Janice → Hannah → ... → Randy  \n“Janice is Amy's descendant” → Amy → Janice → ... → Randy  \n“Amy is Cheryl's descendant” → Cheryl → Amy → ... → Randy  \n“Pamela is Cheryl's ancestor” → Pamela → Cheryl → ... → Randy  \n“Pamela is Megan's descendant” → Megan → Pamela → ... → Randy  \n“Megan is Joseph's descendant” → Joseph → Megan → ... → Randy  \n“Joseph is Ryan's descendant” → Ryan → Joseph → ... → Randy  \n“Roger is Ryan's ancestor” → Roger → Ryan → ... → Randy  \n“Roger is Marilyn's descendant” → Marilyn → Roger → ... → Randy  \n“Catherine is Marilyn's ancestor” → Catherine → Marilyn → ... → Randy  \n“Terry is Catherine's ancestor” → Terry → Catherine → ... → Randy  \n“Terry is Frances's descendant” → Frances → Terry → ... → Randy  \n“Frances is Alice's descendant” → Alice → Frances → ... → Randy  \n“Nancy is Alice's ancestor” → Nancy → Alice → ... → Randy  \n“Elijah is Nancy's ancestor” → Elijah → Nancy → ... → Randy  \n“Elijah is Bruce's descendant” → Bruce → Elijah → ... → Randy  \n“Bruce is Julie's descendant” → Julie → Bruce → ... → Randy  \n“Julie is Joan's descendant” → Joan → Julie → ... → Randy  \n“Joan is Ruth's descendant” → Ruth → Joan → ... → Randy  \n“Philip is Ruth's ancestor” → Philip → Ruth → ... → Randy  \n“Philip is Dennis's descendant” → Dennis → Philip → ... → Randy  \n“Dennis is Keith's descendant” → Keith → Dennis → ... → Randy  \n“Daniel is Keith's ancestor” → Daniel → Keith → Dennis → Philip → ... → Randy\n\nHold on! **Daniel** appears here!\n\nFrom Shirley’s side:\n- Shirley ← James ← Carolyn ← **Daniel**\n\nFrom Randy’s side, we just traced:\n- Randy ← ... ← **Daniel**\n\nSo **Daniel is an ancestor of both Randy and Shirley**.\n\nLet’s verify this path clearly.\n\n### Path from Daniel to Shirley:\n- Daniel → Carolyn → James → Shirley  \n(Given: Carolyn is Daniel's descendant → Daniel → Carolyn  \nJames is Carolyn's descendant → Carolyn → James  \nJames is Shirley's ancestor → James → Shirley)\n\nSo: **Daniel → Carolyn → James → Shirley**\n\n### Path from Daniel to Randy:\n\nWe have:\n- Daniel is Keith's ancestor → Daniel → Keith  \n- Dennis is Keith's descendant → Keith → Dennis  \n- Philip is Dennis's descendant → Dennis → Philip  \n- Philip is Ruth's ancestor → Philip → Ruth  \n- Joan is Ruth's descendant → Ruth → Joan  \n- Julie is Joan's descendant → Joan → Julie  \n- Bruce is Julie's descendant → Julie → Bruce  \n- Elijah is Bruce's descendant → Bruce → Elijah  \n- Elijah is Nancy's ancestor → Elijah → Nancy  \n- Nancy is Alice's ancestor → Nancy → Alice  \n- Frances is Alice's descendant → Alice → Frances  \n- Terry is Frances's descendant → Frances → Terry  \n- Terry is Catherine's ancestor → Terry → Catherine  \n- Catherine is Marilyn's ancestor → Catherine → Marilyn  \n- Roger is Marilyn's descendant → Marilyn → Roger  \n- Roger is Ryan's ancestor → Roger → Ryan  \n- Joseph is Ryan's descendant → Ryan → Joseph  \n- Megan is Joseph's descendant → Joseph → Megan  \n- Pamela is Megan's descendant → Megan → Pamela  \n- Pamela is Cheryl's ancestor → Pamela → Cheryl  \n- Amy is Cheryl's descendant → Cheryl → Amy  \n- Janice is Amy's descendant → Amy → Janice  \n- Hannah is Janice's descendant → Janice → Hannah  \n- Hannah is Andrew's ancestor → Hannah → Andrew  \n- Carl is Andrew's descendant → Andrew → Carl  \n- Alan is Carl's descendant → Carl → Alan  \n- Jennifer is Alan's descendant → Alan → Jennifer  \n- Jerry is Jennifer's descendant → Jennifer → Jerry  \n- Jerry is Martha's ancestor → Jerry → Martha  \n- Martha is Beverly's ancestor → Martha → Beverly  \n- Beverly is Douglas's ancestor → Beverly → Douglas  \n- Peter is Douglas's descendant → Douglas → Peter  \n- Bryan is Peter's descendant → Peter → Bryan  \n- Bryan is Wayne's ancestor → Bryan → Wayne  \n- Wayne is Emily's ancestor → Wayne → Emily  \n- Emily is Aaron's ancestor → Emily → Aaron  \n- Zachary is Aaron's descendant → Aaron → Zachary  \n- Zachary is Carol's ancestor → Zachary → Carol  \n- Carol is Christopher's ancestor → Carol → Christopher  \n- Christopher is Bradley's ancestor → Christopher → Bradley  \n- Bradley is Edward's ancestor → Bradley → Edward  \n- Jean is Edward's descendant → Edward → Jean  \n- Jean is Benjamin's ancestor → Jean → Benjamin  \n- Benjamin is Austin's ancestor → Benjamin → Austin  \n- Austin is Walter's ancestor → Austin → Walter  \n- Gloria is Walter's descendant → Walter → Gloria  \n- Gloria is Charlotte's ancestor → Gloria → Charlotte  \n- Juan is Charlotte's descendant → Charlotte → Juan  \n- Doris is Juan's descendant → Juan → Doris  \n- Doris is Richard's ancestor → Doris → Richard  \n- Barbara is Richard's descendant → Richard → Barbara  \n- Barbara is Frank's ancestor → Barbara → Frank  \n- Frank is Samuel's ancestor → Frank → Samuel  \n- Noah is Samuel's descendant → Samuel → Noah  \n- Noah is Brandon's ancestor → Noah → Brandon  \n- Brandon is Natalie's ancestor → Brandon → Natalie  \n- Natalie is Kelly's ancestor → Natalie → Kelly  \n- Elizabeth is Kelly's descendant → Kelly → Elizabeth  \n- Debra is Elizabeth's descendant → Elizabeth → Debra  \n- Randy is Debra's descendant → Debra → Randy\n\nWow!
