This means Terry is higher up than Christopher, and Edward is lower down.

**3. Julie's Lineage:**

*   Nancy is Julie's descendant.
*   Edward is Julie's ancestor.

This means Edward is higher up than Julie, and Nancy is lower down.

**4. Connecting the Lineages:**

*   Catherine is Terry's ancestor.

This is the key connection. Since Catherine is a descendant of Frank and an ancestor of Terry, it means Frank's lineage is above Terry's.

**Putting it all together:**

1. Roger is an ancestor of Frank.
2. Frank's lineage is above Terry's (because Catherine is both Frank's descendant and Terry's ancestor).
3. Terry is an ancestor of Christopher.
4. Christopher is an ancestor of Edward (because Edward is Christopher's descendant).
5. Edward is an ancestor of Julie.
6. Julie is an ancestor of Nancy (because Nancy is Julie's descendant).

**Therefore, the lineage goes:**

Roger -> ... -> Frank -> ... -> Catherine -> ... -> Terry -> ... -> Christopher -> ... -> Edward -> ... -> Julie -> ... -> Nancy

**Conclusion:**

Roger is higher up in the lineage than Nancy. This means Roger is Nancy's ancestor.
