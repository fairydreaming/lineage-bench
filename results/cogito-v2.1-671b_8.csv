2. From William → Doris (since Doris is William's descendant), we get William → Doris → Maria → Bradley
3. From Frances → William (since Frances is William's ancestor), we get Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley
4. From Heather → Frances (since Frances is Heather's descendant), we get Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley
5. From Alexis → Heather, we get Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley
6. From Eugene → Alexis (since Alexis is Eugene's descendant), we get Eugene → Alexis → Heather → Frances → William → Doris → Maria → Bradley

This complete lineage shows that Eugene is an ancestor of Bradley, as there is a direct ancestral line from Eugene to Bradley through multiple generations.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

2. This shows that:
   - Kenneth is a descendant of both Joshua and Terry
   - There is no direct ancestral relationship between Terry and Joshua
   - They both have Kenneth as a common descendant

3. Looking at the options:
   - Option 1 (common ancestor) is not supported as we don't have information about their ancestors
   - Option 2 (Terry is Joshua's ancestor) is not supported by the given relationships
   - Option 3 (common descendant) is correct as Kenneth is a descendant of both
   - Option 4 (Terry is Joshua's descendant) is not supported
   - Option 5 is not applicable since option 3 is correct

Therefore, the correct answer is that Terry and Joshua share a common descendant (Kenneth).
