- **Bradley is Joan's ancestor.**
- **Bradley is Helen's descendant.**
- **Benjamin is Helen's ancestor.**
- **Julie is Benjamin's ancestor.**
- **Sandra is Julie's ancestor.**

### Step 2: Identify the Ancestors and Descendants of Katherine
- **Katherine is Russell's ancestor.**
- **Theresa is Russell's descendant.**
- **Theresa is Larry's ancestor.**
- **Larry is Ralph's ancestor.**
- **Ralph is Melissa's ancestor.**
- **Melissa is Christine's descendant.**
- **Logan is Christine's descendant.**
- **Anthony is Logan's descendant.**
- **Anthony is Gary's ancestor.**

- **Charlotte is Kimberly's ancestor.**
- **Kimberly is Gerald's ancestor.**
- **Edward is Gerald's descendant.**
- **Edward is Bruce's ancestor.**
- **Sandra is Bruce's descendant.**

From this, we can trace Katherine's lineage as follows:
Katherine → Russell → Theresa → Larry → Ralph → Melissa → Christine → Logan → Anthony → Gary → David → Joe → Nicholas → Diane → Samuel → Harold → Beverly → Ruth → Alice → Tyler → Charlotte → Kimberly → Gerald → Edward → Bruce → Sandra

### Step 3: Compare the Lineages of Margaret and Katherine
- Margaret's lineage: Margaret → Joan → Bradley → Helen → Benjamin → Julie → Sandra
- Katherine's lineage: Katherine → Russell → Theresa → Larry → Ralph → Melissa → Christine → Logan → Anthony → Gary → David → Joe → Nicholas → Diane → Samuel → Harold → Beverly → Ruth → Alice → Tyler → Charlotte → Kimberly → Gerald → Edward → Bruce → Sandra

Both lineages eventually lead to **Sandra**, who is a common ancestor for both Margaret and Katherine.
