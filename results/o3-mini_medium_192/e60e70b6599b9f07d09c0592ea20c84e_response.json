No entry connects the Joseph–Sharon line with the Gloria–Cynthia line. Since no chain of relationships is given that joins Sharon’s ancestry (or descendant line) with Cynthia’s ancestry, we conclude that the provided information does not establish any direct lineage relationship between Sharon and Cynthia (they are not in a parent–child or ancestor–descendant chain with one another, and there is no provided link showing them sharing a common descendant or ancestor).\n\nThus the correct answer is: 5.
