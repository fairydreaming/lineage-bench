So Adam is an ancestor of Rachel.\n\nNo other statement connects James (or Andrea) with Adam (or Rachel). We can trace a short chain in one “family line” leading to James (via Andrea) and a separate chain in the other family line leading to Adam (via Rachel and later individuals) but there is no statement that links any person in the chain of James to any person in the chain of Adam.\n\nThus, we find no evidence that either is an ancestor or descendant of the other, nor that they share any common descendant or common ancestor (by the given clues).
